'''Genetic engineering''', also called '''genetic modification''', is the direct manipulation of an organism's [[genome]] using [[biotechnology]]. It is a set of technologies used to change the genetic makeup of cells, including the transfer of genes within and across species boundaries to produce improved or novel [[organisms]]. New [[DNA]] is obtained by either isolating and copying the genetic material of interest using [[molecular cloning]] methods or by [[Artificial gene synthesis|artificially synthesizing]] the DNA. A [[Vector (molecular biology)|construct]] is usually created and used to insert this DNA into the host organism. As well as inserting [[gene]]s, the process can be used to remove, or "[[Gene knockout|knock out]]", genes. The new DNA can be inserted randomly, or [[Gene targeting|targeted]] to a specific part of the [[genome]].

An organism that is generated through genetic engineering is considered to be genetically modified (GM) and the resulting entity is a [[genetically modified organism]] (GMO). The first GMOs were [[bacteria]] generated in 1973 and the first GM animals were mice in 1974. [[Insulin]]-producing bacteria were commercialized in 1982 and [[genetically modified food]] has been sold since 1994. [[GloFish]], the first GMO designed as a pet, was sold in the United States in December 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=First transgenic pet, ‘GloFish’, sold to US public|url=http://www.phgfoundation.org/news/1304/|newspaper=PHG Foundation|date=9 January 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Genetic engineering techniques]] have been applied in numerous fields including research, agriculture, industrial biotechnology, and medicine. Enzymes used in laundry detergent and medicines such as insulin and human growth hormone are now manufactured in GM cells, experimental GM cell lines and GM animals such as mice or [[zebrafish]] are being used for research purposes, and [[genetically modified crops]] have been commercialized.

Genetic engineering is a process that alters the genetic make-up of an organism by either removing or introducing [[DNA]].

{{main article|Genetic engineering techniques}}

Creating a GMO is a multi-step process. Genetic engineers must first choose what gene they wish to insert into the organism. This is driven by what the aim is for the resultant organism and is built on earlier research. [[Genetic screen|Screens]] can be carried out to determine potential genes and further tests then used to identify the best candidates. The development of [[DNA microarray|microarrays]], [[transcriptome]]s and [[Whole genome sequencing|genome sequencing]] has made it much easier to find suitable genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=jWJ1CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA242&amp;lpg=PA242&amp;dq=genetic+engineering+screen+to+find+target+genes&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ExTec5lWP4&amp;sig=9jiW3UGkfeN82RHwW5H5weFHwF4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjqkfmup8nTAhXKmpQKHVWMAiQQ6AEIUDAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=genetic%20engineering%20screen%20to%20find%20target%20genes&amp;f=false|title=Current Technologies in Plant Molecular Breeding: A Guide Book of Plant Molecular Breeding for Researchers|last=Koh|first=Hee-Jong|last2=Kwon|first2=Suk-Yoon|last3=Thomson|first3=Michael|date=2015-08-26|publisher=Springer|year=|isbn=9789401799966|location=|pages=242|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Luck also plays its part; the round-up ready gene was discovered after scientists noticed a bacterium thriving in the presence of the herbicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2015/how-to-make-a-gmo/|title=How to Make a GMO - Science in the News|date=2015-08-09|work=Science in the News|access-date=2017-04-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gene isolation and cloning ===
{{Main|Molecular cloning}}
The next step is to isolate the candidate gene. The [[Cell (biology)|cell]] containing the gene is opened and the DNA is purified.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=g1v6WMHVkTgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Genetic+Engineering:+Principles+and+Methods&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwimxYGunsnTAhWBspQKHThtDYcQ6AEIRTAH#v=onepage&amp;q=Genetic%20Engineering:%20Principles%20and%20Methods&amp;f=false|title=An Introduction to Genetic Engineering|last=Nicholl|first=Desmond S. T.|date=2008-05-29|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=|isbn=9781139471787|location=|pages=34|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gene is separated by using [[restriction enzymes]] to cut the DNA into fragments&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Alberts B, Johnson A, Lewis J, etal |title= Isolating, Cloning, and Sequencing DNA.|edition= 4th |location=New York|publisher=Garland Science|year= 2002 |url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26837/|chapter=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) to amplify up the gene segment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kaufman|first=R I|last2=Nixon|first2=B T|year=1996|title=Use of PCR to isolate genes encoding sigma54-dependent activators from diverse bacteria|journal=J Bacteriol|volume=178|issue=13|pages=3967–3970|doi=10.1128/jb.178.13.3967-3970.1996|pmc=232662|pmid=8682806}}&lt;/ref&gt; These segments can then be extracted through [[gel electrophoresis]]. If the chosen gene or the donor organism's [[genome]] has been well studied it may already be accessible from a [[Library (biology)|genetic library]]. If the [[DNA sequence]] is known, but no copies of the gene are available, it can also be [[Gene synthesis|artificially synthesized]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/wsbm.104 |title=Synthetic biology: Putting synthesis into biology |year=2011 |last1=Liang |first1=Jing |last2=Luo |first2=Yunzi |last3=Zhao |first3=Huimin |journal=Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Systems Biology and Medicine |volume=3 |pages=7–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once isolated the gene is [[Ligation (molecular biology)|ligated]] into a [[plasmid]] that is then inserted into a bacterium. The plasmid is replicated when the bacteria divide, ensuring unlimited copies of the gene are available.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/006/y4955e/y4955e06.htm|title=5. THE PROCESS OF GENETIC MODIFICATION|website=www.fao.org|access-date=2017-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the gene is inserted into the target organism it must be combined with other genetic elements. These include a [[Promoter (biology)|promoter]] and [[Terminator (genetics)|terminator]] region, which initiate and end [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]]. A [[selectable marker]] gene is added, which in most cases confers [[antibiotic resistance]], so researchers can easily determine which cells have been successfully transformed. The gene can also be modified at this stage for better expression or effectiveness. These manipulations are carried out using [[recombinant DNA]] techniques, such as [[restriction digest]]s, ligations and molecular cloning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1534/genetics.109.112144 |title=Personal Reflections on the Origins and Emergence of Recombinant DNA Technology |year=2010 |last1=Berg |first1=P. |last2=Mertz |first2=J.

===Inserting DNA into the host genome===

{{Main article|Transformation (genetics)}}

There are a number of techniques available for inserting the gene into the host genome. Some bacteria can naturally [[Competence (biology)|take up foreign DNA]]. This ability can be induced in other bacteria via stress (e.g. [[heat shock|thermal]] or electric shock), which increases the cell membrane's permeability to DNA; up-taken DNA can either integrate with the genome or exist as [[extrachromosomal DNA]]. DNA is generally inserted into animal cells using [[microinjection]], where it can be injected through the cell's [[nuclear envelope]] directly into the [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]], or through the use of [[viral vectors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chen |first=I |last2=Dubnau |first2=D |title=DNA uptake during bacterial transformation |journal=Nat. Rev. Microbiol. |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=241–9 |year=2004 |pmid=15083159 |doi=10.1038/nrmicro844}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Agrobacterium-tumefaciens.png|thumb|''[[A. tumefaciens]]'' attaching itself to a carrot cell]]

In plants the DNA is generally inserted using [[Agrobacterium#Uses in biotechnology|''Agrobacterium''-mediated recombination]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK215771/|title=Methods and Mechanisms for Genetic Manipulation of Plants, Animals, and Microorganisms|last=Health|first=National Research Council (US) Committee on Identifying and Assessing Unintended Effects of Genetically Engineered Foods on Human|date=2004-01-01|publisher=National Academies Press (US)|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; taking advantage of the ''Agrobacterium''s [[Transfer DNA|T-DNA]] sequence that allows natural insertion of genetic material into plant cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2003|title=Agrobacterium-Mediated Plant Transformation: The Biology behind the "Gene-Jockeying" Tool|journal=Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews|volume=67|issue=1|pages=16–37, table of contents|doi=10.1128/MMBR.67.1.16-37.2003|pmc=150518|pmid=12626681|last1=Gelvin|first1=S. B.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another method is [[biolistics]], where particles of gold or tungsten are coated with DNA and then shot into young plant cells or plant embryos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Graham |last=Head |last2=Hull |first2=Roger H |last3=Tzotzos |first3=George T. |title=Genetically Modified Plants: Assessing Safety and Managing Risk |publisher=Academic Pr |location=London |year=2009 |page=244 |isbn=0-12-374106-8 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another transformation method for plant and animal cells is [[electroporation]]. This involves subjecting the cell to an electric shock, which can make the cell membrane permeable to plasmid DNA. Due to the damage caused to the cells and DNA the transformation efficiency of biolistics and electroporation is lower than agrobacterial mediated transformation and microinjection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DNA-Delivery Methods to Produce Transgenic Plants|first=Behrooz |last=Darbani |first2=Safar |last2=Farajnia |first3=Mahmoud |last3=Toorchi |first4=Saeed |last4=Zakerbostanabad |first5=Shahin |last5=Noeparvar |first6=C. Neal |last6=Stewart, Jr.|year=2010|publisher=Science Alert|url=http://scialert.net/fulltext/?doi=biotech.2008.385.402|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As only a single cell is transformed with genetic material, the organism must be [[Regeneration (biology)|regenerated]] from that single cell. As bacteria consist of a single cell and reproduce clonally regeneration is not necessary. In plants this is accomplished through the use of [[Plant tissue culture|tissue culture]]. In animals it is necessary to ensure that the inserted DNA is present in the [[embryonic stem cells]]. [[Selectable markers]] are used to easily differentiate transformed from untransformed cells. These markers are usually present in the transgenic organism, although a number of strategies have been developed that can remove the selectable marker from the mature transgenic plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0958-1669(00)00188-9 |title=Elimination of selection markers from transgenic plants |year=2001 |last1=Hohn |first1=Barbara |last2=Levy |first2=Avraham A |last3=Puchta |first3=Holger |journal=Current Opinion in Biotechnology |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=139–43 |pmid=11287227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further testing using [[PCR]], [[Southern hybridization]], and [[DNA sequencing]] is conducted to confirm that an organism contains the new gene. These tests can also confirm the chromosomal location and copy number of the inserted gene. The presence of the gene does not guarantee it will be [[Gene expression|expressed]] at appropriate levels in the target tissue so methods that look for and measure the gene products (RNA and protein) are also used. These include [[northern hybridization]], quantitative [[RT-PCR]], [[Western blot]], [[immunofluorescence]], [[ELISA]] and [[phenotype|phenotypic]] analysis. All offspring from the first generation will be [[heterozygous]] for the inserted gene and must be mated together to produce a [[homozygous]] animal. For stable transformation the gene should be passed to the offspring in a [[Mendelian inheritance]] pattern, so the organism's offspring are also studied.

The new genetic material can be inserted randomly within the host genome or targeted to a specific location. The technique of [[gene targeting]] uses [[homologous recombination]] to make desired changes to a specific [[endogenous]] gene.  This tends to occur at a relatively low frequency in plants and animals and generally requires the use of [[selectable markers]]. The frequency of gene targeting can be greatly enhanced through [[genome editing]]. Genome editing uses artificially engineered [[nuclease]]s that create specific [[double-strand breaks|double-stranded breaks]]  at desired locations in the genome, and use the cell’s endogenous mechanisms to repair the induced break by the natural processes of [[homologous recombination]] and [[Nonhomologous end joining|nonhomologous end-joining]]. There are currently four families of engineered nucleases: [[meganuclease]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=September 2009|title=Efficient targeting of a SCID gene by an engineered single-chain homing endonuclease|url=|journal=Nucleic Acids Res.|volume=37|issue=16|pages=5405–19|doi=10.1093/nar/gkp548|pmc=2760784|pmid=19584299|vauthors=Grizot S, Smith J, Daboussi F, etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=January 2010|title=Heritable targeted mutagenesis in maize using a designed endonuclease|url=|journal=Plant J.|volume=61|issue=1|pages=176–87|doi=10.1111/j.1365-313X.2009.04041.x|pmid=19811621|vauthors=Gao H, Smith J, Yang M, etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[zinc finger nuclease]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=May 2009|title=High-frequency modification of plant genes using engineered zinc-finger nucleases|url=|journal=Nature|volume=459|issue=7245|pages=442–5|bibcode=2009Natur.459..442T|doi=10.1038/nature07845|pmc=2743854|pmid=19404258|vauthors=Townsend JA, Wright DA, Winfrey RJ, etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=May 2009|title=Precise genome modification in the crop species Zea mays using zinc-finger nucleases|journal=Nature|volume=459|issue=7245|pages=437–41|bibcode=2009Natur.459..437S|doi=10.1038/nature07992|pmid=19404259|vauthors=Shukla VK, Doyon Y, Miller JC, etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[transcription activator-like effector nuclease]]s (TALENs),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=July 2010|title=TAL Effector Nucleases Create Targeted DNA Double-strand Breaks|url=|journal=Genetics|volume=186|issue=2|pages=757–61|doi=10.1534/genetics.110.120717|pmc=2942870|pmid=20660643|vauthors=Christian M, Cermak T, Doyle EL, etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=August 2010|title=TAL nucleases (TALNs): hybrid proteins composed of TAL effectors and FokI DNA-cleavage domain|url=|journal=Nucleic Acids Res|volume=39|issue=1|pages=359–72|doi=10.1093/nar/gkq704|pmc=3017587|pmid=20699274|vauthors=Li T, Huang S, Jiang WZ, etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Cas9-guideRNA system (adapted from CRISPR).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last2=Wang|first2=HH.|year=2013|title=Genome-scale engineering for systems and synthetic biology|journal=Mol Syst Biol|volume=9|issue=|page=641|doi=10.1038/msb.2012.66|pmc=3564264|pmid=23340847|last1=Esvelt|first1=KM.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last2=Carlson|first2=DF.|last3=Walton|first3=MW.|last4=Fahrenkrug|first4=SC.|last5=Hackett|first5=PB.|year=2012|title=Precision editing of large animal genomes|journal=Adv Genet|series=Advances in Genetics|volume=80|issue=|pages=37–97|doi=10.1016/B978-0-12-404742-6.00002-8|isbn=9780124047426|pmc=3683964|pmid=23084873|last1=Tan|first1=WS.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to enhancing gene targeting, engineered nucleases can be used to introduce mutations at endogenous genes that generate a [[gene knockout]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ekker|first=S.C.|year=2008|title=Zinc finger-based knockout punches for zebrafish genes|journal=Zebrafish|volume=5|issue=2|pages=1121–3|doi=10.1089/zeb.2008.9988|pmc=2849655|pmid=18554175}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=July 2009|title=Knockout rats via embryo microinjection of zinc-finger nucleases|journal=Science|volume=325|issue=5939|page=433|bibcode=2009Sci...325..433G|doi=10.1126/science.1172447|pmc=2831805|pmid=19628861|vauthors=Geurts AM, Cost GJ, Freyvert Y, etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==

Genetic engineering has applications in medicine, research, industry and agriculture and can be used on a wide range of plants, animals and micro organisms. [[Bacteria]], the first organisms to be genetically modified, can have plasmid DNA inserted containing new genes that code for medicines or enzymes that process food and other [[Enzyme substrate (biology)|substrates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.learner.org/courses/biology/textbook/gmo/gmo_2.html|title=Genetic Modification of Bacteria|publisher=[[Annenberg Foundation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Panesar, Pamit et al (2010) "Enzymes in Food Processing: Fundamentals and Potential Applications", Chapter 10, I K International Publishing House, {{ISBN|978-9380026336}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plants have been modified for insect protection, herbicide resistance, virus resistance, enhanced nutrition, tolerance to environmental pressures and the production of edible vaccines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isaaa.org/gmapprovaldatabase/gmtraitslist/default.asp|title=GM traits list|publisher=International Service for the Acquisition of Agri-Biotech Applications}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most commercialised GMOs are insect resistant and/or herbicide tolerant crop plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isaaa.org/resources/publications/briefs/43/executivesummary/default.asp|title=ISAAA Brief 43-2011: Executive Summary|publisher=International Service for the Acquisition of Agri-Biotech Applications}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genetically modified animals have been used for research, model animals and the production of agricultural or pharmaceutical products.

Genetic engineering is an important tool for [[natural scientists]]. Genes and other genetic information from a wide range of organisms are transformed into bacteria for storage and modification, creating [[genetically modified bacteria]] in the process. Bacteria are cheap, easy to grow, [[Clone (cell biology)|clonal]], multiply quickly, relatively easy to transform and can be stored at -80&amp;nbsp;°C almost indefinitely. Once a gene is isolated it can be stored inside the bacteria providing an unlimited supply for research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.learner.org/courses/biology/textbook/gmo/gmo_2.html|title=Rediscovering Biology - Online Textbook: Unit 13 Genetically Modified Organisms|website=www.learner.org|access-date=2017-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organisms are genetically engineered to discover the functions of certain genes. This could be the effect on the phenotype of the organism, where the gene is expressed or what other genes it interacts with. These experiments generally involve loss of function, gain of function, tracking and expression.

* '''Loss of function experiments''', such as in a [[gene knockout]] experiment, in which an organism is engineered to lack the activity of one or more genes. In a simple knockout a copy of the desired gene has been altered to make it non-functional. [[Embryonic stem cells]] incorporate the altered gene, which replaces the already present functional copy. These stem cells are injected into [[blastocyst]]s, which are implanted into surrogate mothers. This allows the experimenter to analyze the defects caused by this [[mutation]] and thereby determine the role of particular genes. It is used especially frequently in [[developmental biology]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alberts|first=Bruce|last2=Johnson|first2=Alexander|last3=Lewis|first3=Julian|last4=Raff|first4=Martin|last5=Roberts|first5=Keith|last6=Walter|first6=Peter|date=2002|title=Studying Gene Expression and Function|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK26818/|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Gain of function experiments''', the logical counterpart of knockouts. These are sometimes performed in conjunction with knockout experiments to more finely establish the function of the desired gene. The process is much the same as that in knockout engineering, except that the construct is designed to increase the function of the gene, usually by providing extra copies of the gene or inducing synthesis of the protein more frequently. Gain of function is used to tell whether or not a protein is sufficient for a function, but does not always mean it's required, especially when dealing with genetic or functional redundancy.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
* '''Tracking experiments''', which seek to gain information about the localization and interaction of the desired protein. One way to do this is to replace the wild-type gene with a 'fusion' gene, which is a juxtaposition of the wild-type gene with a reporting element such as [[green fluorescent protein]] (GFP) that will allow easy visualization of the products of the genetic modification. While this is a useful technique, the manipulation can destroy the function of the gene, creating secondary effects and possibly calling into question the results of the experiment. More sophisticated techniques are now in development that can track protein products without mitigating their function, such as the addition of small sequences that will serve as binding motifs to monoclonal antibodies.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
* '''Expression studies''' aim to discover where and when specific proteins are produced. In these experiments, the DNA sequence before the DNA that codes for a protein, known as a gene's [[promoter (biology)|promoter]], is reintroduced into an organism with the protein coding region replaced by a reporter gene such as GFP or an enzyme that catalyzes the production of a dye. Thus the time and place where a particular protein is produced can be observed. Expression studies can be taken a step further by altering the promoter to find which pieces are crucial for the proper expression of the gene and are actually bound by transcription factor proteins; this process is known as [[promoter bashing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=ed4_CQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA114&amp;lpg=PA114&amp;dq=genetically+engineering+%22promoter+bashing%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=lBHJ-WRplM&amp;sig=9_Ai3toQAWmYrZGin9_bw3_0_QQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi5qIeMueDVAhUDU7wKHcdJBhIQ6AEIRDAG#v=onepage&amp;q=genetically%20engineering%20%22promoter%20bashing%22&amp;f=false|title=Techniques in Genetic Engineering|last=Kurnaz|first=Isil Aksan|date=2015-05-08|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781482260908|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the best-known and [[Genetically modified food controversies|controversial]] applications of genetic engineering is the creation and use of [[genetically modified crops]] or [[genetically modified livestock]] to produce [[genetically modified food]].

==Controversy==

{{Main article|Genetically modified food controversies|}}

Critics have objected to the use of genetic engineering on several grounds, that include ethical, ecological and economic concerns. Many of these concerns involve GM crops and whether food produced from them is safe, whether it should be labeled and what impact growing them will have on the environment. These controversies have led to litigation, international trade disputes, and protests, and to restrictive regulation of commercial products in some countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheldon|first=Ian M.|date=2002-03-01|title=Regulation of biotechnology: will we ever ‘freely’ trade GMOs?|url=https://academic.oup.com/erae/article-abstract/29/1/155/558037/Regulation-of-biotechnology-will-we-ever-freely|journal=European Review of Agricultural Economics|volume=29|issue=1|pages=155–176|doi=10.1093/erae/29.1.155|issn=0165-1587}}&lt;/ref&gt;
