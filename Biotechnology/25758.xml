[[File:Pre-mRNA-1ysv-tubes.png|thumb|right|A hairpin loop from a pre-mRNA. Highlighted are the [[nucleobase]]s (green) and the ribose-phosphate backbone (blue). Note that this is a single strand of RNA that folds back upon itself.]]

'''Ribonucleic acid''' ('''RNA''') is a [[polymer]]ic molecule essential in various biological roles in [[Genetic code|coding]], [[Translation (biology)|decoding]], [[Regulatory RNA|regulation]], and [[RNA splicing|expression]] of [[gene]]s. RNA and [[DNA]] are [[nucleic acid]]s, and, along with [[lipid]]s, [[protein]]s and [[carbohydrate]]s, constitute the four major [[macromolecule]]s essential for all known forms of [[life]]. Like DNA, RNA is assembled as a chain of [[nucleotide]]s, but unlike DNA it is more often found in nature as a single-strand folded onto itself, rather than a paired double-strand. Cellular organisms use [[messenger RNA]] ('''''mRNA''''') to convey genetic information (using the letters G, U, A, and C to denote the nitrogenous bases [[guanine]], [[uracil]], [[adenine]], and [[cytosine]]) that directs synthesis of specific proteins. Many [[virus]]es encode their genetic information using an RNA [[genome]].

Some RNA molecules play an active role within cells by catalyzing biological reactions, controlling [[gene expression]], or sensing and communicating responses to cellular signals. One of these active processes is [[Protein biosynthesis|protein synthesis]], a universal function where RNA molecules direct the assembly of proteins on [[ribosome]]s. This process uses [[transfer RNA]] ('''''tRNA''''') molecules to deliver [[amino acid]]s to the ribosome, where [[ribosomal RNA]] ('''''rRNA''''') then links amino acids together to form proteins.

==Comparison with DNA==

&lt;div style="overflow:hidden"&gt;
The chemical structure of RNA is very similar to that of [[DNA]], but differs in three main ways:
* Unlike double-stranded DNA, RNA is a single-stranded molecule&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/molecules/rnamolecule/ | title =RNA: The Versatile Molecule | publisher =[[University of Utah]] | year =2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in many of its biological roles and has a much shorter chain of nucleotides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.chem.ucla.edu/harding/notes/notes_14C_nucacids.pdf | title =Nucleotides and Nucleic Acids | publisher =[[University of California, Los Angeles]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, RNA can, by complementary base pairing, form intrastrand (i.e., single-strand) double helixes, as in tRNA.
* While DNA contains ''[[deoxyribose]]'', RNA contains ''[[ribose]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=7-UKCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT386&amp;lpg=PT386&amp;dq=dna+contains+deoxyribose+rna+ribose#v=onepage&amp;q=dna%20contains%20deoxyribose%20rna%20ribose&amp;f=false | title =Analysis of Chromosomes | author =R.N. Shukla | isbn =9789384568177| date =2014-06-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (in deoxyribose there is no hydroxyl group attached to the pentose ring in the [[nucleic acid nomenclature|2']] position). These hydroxyl groups make RNA less stable than DNA because it is more prone to [[hydrolysis]].
* The complementary base to [[adenine]] in DNA is [[thymine]], whereas in RNA, it is [[uracil]], which is an [[methylation|unmethylated]] form of thymine.&lt;ref name=Biochemistry/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Like DNA, most biologically active RNAs, including [[mRNA]], [[tRNA]], [[rRNA]], [[snRNA]]s, and other [[non-coding RNA]]s, contain self-complementary sequences that allow parts of the RNA to fold&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=I.

Analysis of these RNAs has revealed that they are highly structured. Unlike DNA, their structures do not consist of long double helices, but rather collections of short helices packed together into structures akin to proteins.
In this fashion, RNAs can achieve chemical [[catalysis]] (like enzymes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Higgs PG|title=RNA secondary structure: physical and computational aspects|journal=Quarterly Reviews of Biophysics|date=2000|volume=33|pages=199–253|doi=10.1017/S0033583500003620|pmid = 11191843|issue=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, determination of the structure of the ribosome—an enzyme that catalyzes peptide bond formation—revealed that its active site is composed entirely of RNA.&lt;ref name=ribosome_activity&gt;{{cite journal|author=Nissen P|author2=Hansen J|author3=Ban N|author4=Moore PB|author5=Steitz TA|title=The structural basis of ribosome activity in peptide bond synthesis|journal=Science|date=2000|volume=289|issue=5481|pages=920–30|doi=10.1126/science.289.5481.920|pmid = 10937990|bibcode = 2000Sci...289..920N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Piwi-siRNA-basepairing.png|thumb|right|230px|Watson-Crick base pairs in a [[siRNA]] (hydrogen atoms are not shown)]]
Each [[nucleotide]] in RNA contains a [[ribose]] sugar, with carbons numbered 1' through 5'. A base is attached to the 1' position, in general, [[adenine]] (A), [[cytosine]] (C), [[guanine]] (G), or [[uracil]] (U). Adenine and guanine are [[purine]]s, cytosine and uracil are [[pyrimidine]]s. A [[phosphate]] group is attached to the 3' position of one ribose and the 5' position of the next. The phosphate groups have a negative charge each, making RNA a charged molecule (polyanion). The bases form [[hydrogen bond]]s between cytosine and guanine, between adenine and uracil and between guanine and uracil.&lt;ref name="pmid15561141"/&gt; However, other interactions are possible, such as a group of adenine bases binding to each other in a bulge,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=RNA biochemistry and biotechnology|author=Barciszewski J|author2=Frederic B|author3=Clark C|date=1999|pages=73–87|publisher=Springer|isbn=0-7923-5862-7|oclc=52403776}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:RNA chemical structure.GIF|thumb|left|Chemical structure of RNA]]
An important structural feature of RNA that distinguishes it from DNA is the presence of a [[hydroxyl]] group at the 2' position of the ribose sugar. The presence of this functional group causes the helix to mostly adopt the [[A-DNA|A-form geometry]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Salazar M|author2=Fedoroff OY|author3=Miller JM|author4=Ribeiro NS|author5=Reid BR|title=The DNA strand in DNAoRNA hybrid duplexes is neither B-form nor A-form in solution|journal=Biochemistry|date=1992|volume=32|issue=16|pages=4207–15|pmid=7682844|doi=10.1021/bi00067a007}}&lt;/ref&gt; although in single strand dinucleotide contexts, RNA can rarely also adopt the B-form most commonly observed in DNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Sedova A|author2=Banavali NK|title=RNA approaches the B-form in stacked single strand dinucleotide contexts|journal=Biopolymers|date=2016|volume=105|issue=2|pages=65–82|pmid=26443416|doi=10.1002/bip.22750}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The A-form geometry results in a very deep and narrow major groove and a shallow and wide minor groove.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hermann T|author2=Patel DJ|title=RNA bulges as architectural and recognition motifs|journal=Structure|date=2000|volume=8|issue=3|pages=R47–R54|doi=10.1016/S0969-2126(00)00110-6|pmid = 10745015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A second consequence of the presence of the 2'-hydroxyl group is that in conformationally flexible regions of an RNA molecule (that is, not involved in formation of a double helix), it can chemically attack the adjacent phosphodiester bond to cleave the backbone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Mikkola S|author2=Stenman E|author3=Nurmi K|author4=Yousefi-Salakdeh E|author5=Strömberg R|author6=Lönnberg H|title=The mechanism of the metal ion promoted cleavage of RNA phosphodiester bonds involves a general acid catalysis by the metal aquo ion on the departure of the leaving group|journal=Perkin transactions 2|date=1999|pages=1619–26|doi=10.1039/a903691a|issue=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ciliate telomerase RNA.JPG|thumb|[[Secondary structure]] of a [[telomerase RNA]].]]
RNA is transcribed with only four bases (adenine, cytosine, guanine and uracil),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Clinical gene analysis and manipulation: Tools, techniques and troubleshooting|author=Jankowski JAZ|author2=Polak JM|date=1996|page=14|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-47896-0|oclc=33838261}}&lt;/ref&gt; but these bases and attached sugars can be modified in numerous ways as the RNAs mature. [[Pseudouridine]] (Ψ), in which the linkage between uracil and ribose is changed from a C–N bond to a C–C bond, and ribothymidine (T) are found in various places (the most notable ones being in the TΨC loop of [[tRNA]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Yu Q|author2=Morrow CD|title=Identification of critical elements in the tRNA acceptor stem and TΨC loop necessary for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infectivity|journal=J Virol|date=2001|volume=75|issue=10|pages=4902–6|doi=10.1128/JVI.75.10.4902-4906.2001|pmid = 11312362|pmc=114245 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another notable modified base is hypoxanthine, a deaminated adenine base whose [[nucleoside]] is called [[inosine]] (I). Inosine plays a key role in the [[wobble hypothesis]] of the [[genetic code]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Elliott MS|author2=Trewyn RW|title=Inosine biosynthesis in transfer RNA by an enzymatic insertion of hypoxanthine|journal=J.

There are more than 100 other naturally occurring modified nucleosides,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cantara|first=WA|author2=Crain, PF |author3=Rozenski, J |author4=McCloskey, JA |author5=Harris, KA |author6=Zhang, X |author7=Vendeix, FA |author8=Fabris, D |author9= Agris, PF |title=The RNA Modification Database, RNAMDB: 2011 update|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|date=January 2011|volume=39|issue=Database issue|pages=D195–201|pmid=21071406|doi=10.1093/nar/gkq1028|pmc=3013656}}&lt;/ref&gt; The greatest structural diversity of modifications can be found in [[tRNA]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=TRNA: Structure, biosynthesis, and function|author=Söll D|author2=RajBhandary U|date=1995|page=165|publisher=ASM Press|isbn=1-55581-073-X|oclc=183036381 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while pseudouridine and nucleosides with [[2'-O-methylation|2'-O-methylribose]] often present in rRNA are the most common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kiss T|title=Small nucleolar RNA-guided post-transcriptional modification of cellular RNAs|journal=The EMBO Journal|date=2001|volume=20|pages=3617–22|doi=10.1093/emboj/20.14.3617|pmid = 11447102|pmc=125535|issue=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The specific roles of many of these modifications in RNA are not fully understood. However, it is notable that, in ribosomal RNA, many of the post-transcriptional modifications occur in highly functional regions, such as the peptidyl transferase center and the subunit interface, implying that they are important for normal function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=King TH|author2= Liu B|author3=McCully RR|author4=Fournier MJ|title=Ribosome structure and activity are altered in cells lacking snoRNPs that form pseudouridines in the peptidyl transferase center|journal=Molecular Cell|date=2002|volume=11|issue=2|pages=425–35|doi=10.1016/S1097-2765(03)00040-6|pmid = 12620230}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The functional form of single-stranded RNA molecules, just like proteins, frequently requires a specific [[RNA Tertiary Structure|tertiary structure]]. The scaffold for this structure is provided by [[secondary structure|secondary structural]] elements that are hydrogen bonds within the molecule. This leads to several recognizable "domains" of secondary structure like [[hairpin loop]]s, bulges, and [[internal loop]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Mathews DH|author2=Disney MD|author3=Childs JL|author4=Schroeder SJ|author5=Zuker M|author6=Turner DH|title=Incorporating chemical modification constraints into a dynamic programming algorithm for prediction of RNA secondary structure|journal=Proc.

The naturally occurring [[enantiomer]] of RNA is &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-RNA composed of &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-ribonucleotides. All chirality centers are located in the &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-ribose. By the use of &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-ribose or rather &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-ribonucleotides, &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-RNA can be synthesized. &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-RNA is much more stable against degradation by [[ribonuclease|RNase]].&lt;ref name="pmid25236655"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Vater A |author2=Klussmann S |title=Turning mirror-image oligonucleotides into drugs: the evolution of Spiegelmer therapeutics |journal=Drug Discovery Today |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=147–155 | date=January  2015 |pmid=25236655 |doi=10.1016/j.drudis.2014.09.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like other structured biopolymers such as proteins, one can define topology of a folded RNA molecule. This is often done based on arrangement of intra-chain contacts within a folded RNA, termed as [[circuit topology]].

==Synthesis==
Synthesis of RNA is usually catalyzed by an enzyme—[[RNA polymerase]]—using DNA as a template, a process known as [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]]. Initiation of transcription begins with the binding of the enzyme to a [[promoter (biology)|promoter]] sequence in the DNA (usually found "upstream" of a gene). The DNA double helix is unwound by the [[helicase]] activity of the enzyme. The enzyme then progresses along the template strand in the 3’ to 5’ direction, synthesizing a complementary RNA molecule with elongation occurring in the 5’ to 3’ direction. The DNA sequence also dictates where termination of RNA synthesis will occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Nudler E|author2=Gottesman ME|title=Transcription termination and anti-termination in E. coli|journal=Genes to Cells|date=2002|volume=7|pages=755–68|doi=10.1046/j.1365-2443.2002.00563.x|pmid = 12167155|issue=8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Primary transcript]] RNAs are often [[Post-transcriptional modification|modified]] by enzymes after transcription. For example, a [[poly(A) tail]] and a [[5' cap]] are added to eukaryotic [[pre-mRNA]] and [[intron]]s are removed by the [[spliceosome]].

There are also a number of [[RNA-dependent RNA polymerase]]s that use RNA as their template for synthesis of a new strand of RNA. For instance, a number of RNA viruses (such as poliovirus) use this type of enzyme to replicate their genetic material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Jeffrey L Hansen|author2=Alexander M Long|author3=Steve C Schultz|title=Structure of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of poliovirus|journal=Structure|date=1997|volume=5|issue=8|pages=1109–22|doi=10.1016/S0969-2126(97)00261-X|pmid = 9309225 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase is part of the [[RNA interference]] pathway in many organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ahlquist P|title=RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerases, Viruses, and RNA Silencing|journal=Science|date=2002|volume=296|issue=5571|pages=1270–73|doi=10.1126/science.1069132|pmid = 12016304 |bibcode = 2002Sci...296.1270A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Messenger RNA]] (mRNA) carries information about a protein sequence to the [[ribosome]]s, the protein synthesis factories in the cell. It is [[genetic code|coded]] so that every three nucleotides (a [[codon]]) corresponds to one amino acid. In [[eukaryotic]] cells, once precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) has been transcribed from DNA, it is processed to mature mRNA. This removes its [[intron]]s—non-coding sections of the pre-mRNA. The mRNA is then exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where it is bound to ribosomes and [[Translation (biology)|translated]] into its corresponding protein form with the help of [[tRNA]]. In prokaryotic cells, which do not have nucleus and cytoplasm compartments, mRNA can bind to ribosomes while it is being transcribed from DNA. After a certain amount of time the message degrades into its component nucleotides with the assistance of [[ribonuclease]]s.&lt;ref name=The_Cell/&gt;

[[Transfer RNA]] (tRNA) is a small RNA chain of about 80 [[nucleotide]]s that transfers a specific amino acid to a growing [[polypeptide]] chain at the ribosomal site of protein synthesis during translation. It has sites for amino acid attachment and an [[anticodon]] region for [[codon]] recognition that binds to a specific sequence on the messenger RNA chain through hydrogen bonding.&lt;ref name=transcriptome/&gt;

[[Ribosomal RNA]] (rRNA) is the catalytic component of the ribosomes. Eukaryotic ribosomes contain four different rRNA molecules: 18S, 5.8S, 28S and 5S rRNA. Three of the rRNA molecules are synthesized in the [[nucleolus]], and one is synthesized elsewhere. In the cytoplasm, ribosomal RNA and protein combine to form a nucleoprotein called a ribosome. The ribosome binds mRNA and carries out protein synthesis. Several ribosomes may be attached to a single mRNA at any time.&lt;ref name=The_Cell&gt;{{cite book|title=The Cell: A Molecular Approach|edition=3rd|author=Cooper GC|author2=Hausman RE|date=2004|pages=261–76, 297, 339–44|publisher=Sinauer|isbn=0-87893-214-3|oclc=174924833 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly all the RNA found in a typical eukaryotic cell is rRNA.

[[tmRNA|Transfer-messenger RNA]] (tmRNA) is found in many [[bacteria]] and [[plastid]]s. It tags proteins encoded by mRNAs that lack stop codons for degradation and prevents the ribosome from stalling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Gueneau de Novoa P, Williams KP|title=The tmRNA website: reductive evolution of tmRNA in plastids and other endosymbionts|journal=Nucleic Acids Res|volume=32|issue=Database issue|pages=D104–8|date=2004|pmid=14681369|doi=10.1093/nar/gkh102|pmc=308836|last2=Williams}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In RNA processing===
[[File:Synthesis of Pseudouridine.svg|thumb|Uridine to pseudouridine is a common RNA modification.]]
Many RNAs are involved in modifying other RNAs.
[[Intron]]s are [[Splicing (genetics)|spliced]] out of [[pre-mRNA]] by [[spliceosome]]s, which contain several [[small nuclear RNA]]s (snRNA),&lt;ref name=Biochemistry/&gt; or the introns can be ribozymes that are spliced by themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Steitz TA|author2=Steitz JA|title=A general two-metal-ion mechanism for catalytic RNA|journal=Proc.

RNA can also be altered by having its nucleotides modified to  nucleotides other than [[adenosine|A]], [[cytidine|C]], [[guanosine|G]] and [[uridine|U]].
In eukaryotes, modifications of RNA nucleotides are in general directed by [[small nucleolar RNA]]s (snoRNA; 60-300&amp;nbsp;nt),&lt;ref name=transcriptome&gt;{{cite book|title=Mining the transcriptome&amp;nbsp;– methods and applications|url=http://kth.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:10803/FULLTEXT01|author=Wirta W|date=2006|isbn=91-7178-436-5|publisher=School of Biotechnology, Royal Institute of Technology|location=Stockholm|oclc=185406288}}&lt;/ref&gt; found in the [[nucleolus]] and [[Cajal body|cajal bodies]]. snoRNAs associate with enzymes and guide them to a spot on an RNA by basepairing to that RNA.

===RNA genomes===
Like DNA, RNA can carry genetic information. [[RNA virus]]es have [[genome]]s composed of RNA that encodes a number of proteins. The viral genome is replicated by some of those proteins, while other proteins protect the genome as the virus particle moves to a new host cell. [[Viroid]]s are another group of pathogens, but they consist only of RNA, do not encode any protein and are replicated by a host plant cell's polymerase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Daròs JA|author2=Elena SF|author3=Flores R|title=Viroids: an Ariadne's thread into the RNA labyrinth|journal=EMBO Rep|volume=7|issue=6|pages=593–8|date=2006|pmid=16741503|doi=10.1038/sj.embor.7400706|pmc=1479586}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In reverse transcription===
Reverse transcribing viruses replicate their genomes by [[Reverse transcription|reverse transcribing]] DNA copies from their RNA; these DNA copies are then transcribed to new RNA. [[Retrotransposon]]s also spread by copying DNA and RNA from one another,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kalendar R|author2=Vicient CM|author3=Peleg O|author4=Anamthawat-Jonsson K|author5=Bolshoy A|author6=Schulman AH|title=Large retrotransposon derivatives: abundant, conserved but nonautonomous retroelements of barley and related genomes|journal=Genetics|volume=166|issue=3|pages = 1437–50|date=2004|pmid=15082561|doi = 10.1534/genetics.166.3.1437|pmc=1470764}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[telomerase]] contains an RNA that is used as template for building the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Podlevsky JD|author2=Bley CJ|author3=Omana RV|author4=Qi X|author5=Chen JJ|title=The telomerase database|journal=Nucleic Acids Res|volume=36|issue=Database issue|pages=D339–43|date=2008|pmid=18073191|doi=10.1093/nar/gkm700|pmc=2238860}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Double-stranded RNA===
Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is RNA with two complementary strands, similar to the DNA found in all cells. dsRNA forms the genetic material of some [[virus]]es ([[double-stranded RNA viruses]]). Double-stranded RNA such as viral RNA or [[siRNA]] can trigger [[RNA interference]] in [[eukaryote]]s, as well as [[interferon]] response in [[vertebrate]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Blevins | first1 = T. | last2 = Rajeswaran | first2 = R. | last3 = Shivaprasad | first3 = PV. | last4 = Beknazariants | first4 = D. | last5 = Si-Ammour | first5 = A. | last6 = Park | first6 = HS. | last7 = Vazquez | first7 = F. | last8 = Robertson | first8 = D. | last9 = Meins | first9 = F. | title = Four plant Dicers mediate viral small RNA biogenesis and DNA virus induced silencing | journal = Nucleic Acids Res | volume = 34 | issue = 21 | pages = 6233–46 | date=  2006 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkl886 | pmid = 17090584 | pmc=1669714}}

=== Circular RNA ===

Recently, it was shown that there is a single stranded covalently closed, ''i.e.'' circular form of RNA expressed throughout the animal and plant kingdom (see [[Circular RNA|circRNA]]). circRNAs are thought to arise via a "back-splice" reaction where the [[spliceosome]] joins a downstream donor to an upstream acceptor splice site. So far the function of circRNAs is largely unknown, although for few examples a microRNA sponging activity has been demonstrated.

==Key discoveries in RNA biology==
{{further|History of RNA biology}}
[[File:R Holley.jpg|thumb|210px|Robert W. Holley, left, poses with his research team.]]
Research on RNA has led to many important biological discoveries and numerous Nobel Prizes. [[Nucleic acid]]s were discovered in 1868 by [[Friedrich Miescher]], who called the material 'nuclein' since it was found in the [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Dahm R|title=Friedrich Miescher and the discovery of DNA|journal=Developmental Biology|date=2005|volume=278|issue=2|pages=274–88|pmid=15680349|doi = 10.1016/j.ydbio.2004.11.028}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later discovered that prokaryotic cells, which do not have a nucleus, also contain nucleic acids. The role of RNA in protein synthesis was suspected already in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Nature|author=Caspersson T|author2=Schultz J|title=Pentose nucleotides in the cytoplasm of growing tissues|date=1939|volume=143|doi=10.1038/143602c0|pages=602–3|issue=3623|bibcode=1939Natur.143..602C}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Severo Ochoa]] won the 1959 [[Nobel Prize in Medicine]] (shared with [[Arthur Kornberg]]) after he discovered an enzyme that can synthesize RNA in the laboratory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ochoa S|title=Enzymatic synthesis of ribonucleic acid|work=Nobel Lecture|date=1959|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1959/ochoa-lecture.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the enzyme discovered by Ochoa ([[polynucleotide phosphorylase]]) was later shown to be responsible for RNA degradation, not RNA synthesis. In 1956 Alex Rich and David Davies hybridized two separate strands of RNA to form the first crystal of RNA whose structure could be determined by X-ray crystallography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Rich A | author2=Davies, D|title=A New Two-Stranded Helical Structure: Polyadenylic Acid and Polyuridylic Acid|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|date=1956|volume=78|issue=14|doi=10.1021/ja01595a086|pages=3548–3549}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sequence of the 77 nucleotides of a yeast tRNA was found by [[Robert W. Holley]] in 1965,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Holley RW|title=Structure of a ribonucleic acid|journal=Science|date=1965|volume=147|issue=3664|pages=1462–65|doi=10.1126/science.147.3664.1462|pmid = 14263761 |bibcode = 1965Sci...147.1462H|last2=Apgar|first2=J.|last3=Everett|first3=G.

In 1967, [[Carl Woese]] hypothesized that RNA might be catalytic and suggested that the earliest forms of life (self-replicating molecules) could have relied on RNA both to carry genetic information and to catalyze biochemical reactions—an [[RNA world hypothesis|RNA world]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Common sequence structure properties and stable regions in RNA secondary structures |author=Siebert S |date=2006 |page=1 |url=http://deposit.ddb.de/cgi-bin/dokserv?idn=982323891&amp;dok_var=d1&amp;dok_ext=pdf&amp;filename=982323891.pdf |work=Dissertation, Albert-Ludwigs-Universität, Freiburg im Breisgau |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309212648/http://deposit.ddb.de/cgi-bin/dokserv?idn=982323891&amp;dok_var=d1&amp;dok_ext=pdf&amp;filename=982323891.pdf |archivedate=March 9, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The origin of the genetic code: amino acids as cofactors in an RNA world|author=Szathmáry E|journal=Trends Genet|date=1999|volume=15|issue=6|pages=223–9|doi=10.1016/S0168-9525(99)01730-8|pmid = 10354582 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early 1970s, [[retrovirus]]es and [[reverse transcriptase]] were discovered, showing for the first time that enzymes could copy RNA into DNA (the opposite of the usual route for transmission of genetic information). For this work, [[David Baltimore]], [[Renato Dulbecco]] and [[Howard Temin]] were awarded a Nobel Prize in 1975.
In 1976, [[Walter Fiers]] and his team determined the first complete nucleotide sequence of an RNA virus genome, that of [[bacteriophage MS2]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Fiers W|title=Complete nucleotide-sequence of bacteriophage MS2-RNA: primary and secondary structure of replicase gene|journal=Nature|date=1976|volume=260|pages=500–7|pmid=1264203|doi = 10.1038/260500a0|first12=M|issue=5551|bibcode=1976Natur.260..500F|last2=Ysebaert|first2=R.|last3=Duerinck|first3=F.|last4=Haegeman|first4=G.|last5=Iserentant|first5=D.|last6=Merregaert|first6=J.|last7=Min Jou|first7=W.|last8=Molemans|first8=F.|last9=Raeymaekers|first9=A.|last10=Van Den Berghe|first10=A.|last11=Volckaert|first11=G.|last12=Ysebaert|name-list-format=vanc|displayauthors=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, [[intron]]s and [[RNA splicing]] were discovered in both mammalian viruses and in cellular genes, resulting in a 1993 Nobel to [[Philip A. Sharp|Philip Sharp]] and [[Richard J. Roberts|Richard Roberts]].
Catalytic RNA molecules ([[ribozyme]]s) were discovered in the early 1980s, leading to a 1989 Nobel award to [[Thomas Cech]] and [[Sidney Altman]]. In 1990, it was found in ''[[Petunia]]'' that introduced genes can silence similar genes of the plant's own, now known to be a result of [[RNA interference]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Napoli C|author2=Lemieux C|author3=Jorgensen R|title=Introduction of a chimeric chalcone synthase gene into petunia results in reversible co-suppression of homologous genes in trans|journal=Plant Cell|date=1990|volume=2|issue=4|pages=279–89|pmid=12354959|doi = 10.1105/tpc.2.4.279|pmc=159885}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Dafny-Yelin M|author2=Chung SM|author3=Frankman EL|author4=Tzfira T|title=pSAT RNA interference vectors: a modular series for multiple gene down-regulation in plants|journal=Plant Physiol.|volume=145|issue=4|pages=1272–81|date=December 2007|pmid=17766396|pmc=2151715|doi=10.1104/pp.107.106062}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At about the same time, 22 nt long RNAs, now called [[microRNA]]s, were found to have a role in the [[developmental biology|development]] of ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans|C. elegans]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ruvkun G|title=Glimpses of a tiny RNA world|journal=Science|date=2001|volume=294|issue=5543|pages=797–99|doi=10.1126/science.1066315|pmid = 11679654}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Studies on RNA interference gleaned a Nobel Prize for [[Andrew Z. Fire|Andrew Fire]] and [[Craig Mello]] in 2006, and another Nobel was awarded for studies on the transcription of RNA to [[Roger Kornberg]] in the same year. The discovery of gene regulatory RNAs has led to attempts to develop drugs made of RNA, such as [[siRNA]], to silence genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Fichou Y|author2=Férec C|title=The potential of oligonucleotides for therapeutic applications|journal=Trends in Biotechnology|date=2006|volume=24|issue=12|pages=563–70|doi=10.1016/j.tibtech.2006.10.003|pmid = 17045686}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution==
In March 2015, complex [[DNA]] and RNA [[Nucleotide|nucleotides]], including [[uracil]], [[cytosine]] and [[thymine]], were reportedly formed in the laboratory under [[outer space]] conditions, using starter chemicals, such as [[pyrimidine]], an [[organic compound]] commonly found in [[Meteorite|meteorites]]. Pyrimidine, like [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons]] (PAHs), is one of the most carbon-rich compounds found in the [[Universe]] and may have been formed in [[Red giant|red giants]] or in [[Cosmic dust|interstellar dust]] and gas clouds.&lt;ref name="NASA-20150303"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/content/nasa-ames-reproduces-the-building-blocks-of-life-in-laboratory|title=NASA Ames Reproduces the Building Blocks of Life in Laboratory|last=Marlaire|first=Ruth|date=3 March 2015|work=[[NASA]]|accessdate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
