A '''restriction enzyme''' or '''restriction [[endonuclease]]''' is an [[enzyme]] that cleaves DNA into fragments at or near specific recognition sites within the molecule known as [[restriction sites]].&lt;ref name="pmid795607"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Roberts RJ | title = Restriction endonucleases | journal = CRC Critical Reviews in Biochemistry | volume = 4 | issue = 2 | pages = 123–64 | date = Nov 1976 | pmid = 795607 | doi = 10.3109/10409237609105456 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid2172084"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kessler C, Manta V | title = Specificity of restriction endonucleases and DNA modification methyltransferases a review (Edition 3) | journal = Gene | volume = 92 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 1–248 | date = Aug 1990 | pmid = 2172084 | doi = 10.1016/0378-1119(90)90486-B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="isbn0-89603-234-5"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Pingoud A, Alves J, Geiger R | editor = Burrell M | title = Enzymes of Molecular Biology | edition = | publisher = Humana Press | location = Totowa, NJ | series= Methods of Molecular Biology | volume= 16 | year = 1993 | pages = 107–200 | chapter = Chapter 8: Restriction Enzymes | quote = | isbn = 0-89603-234-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Restriction enzymes are commonly classified into four types, which differ in their structure and whether they cut their DNA [[Enzyme substrate (biology)|substrate]] at their recognition site, or if the recognition and cleavage sites are separate from one another.

== History ==
The term restriction enzyme originated from the studies of [[lambda phage|phage λ]], a virus that infects bacteria, and the phenomenon of host-controlled restriction and modification of such bacterial phage or [[bacteriophage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=From Genes to Clones | author = Winnacker E-L|publisher=VCH |year=1987 |chapter= Chapter 2: Isolation, Identification, and Characterisation of DNA fragments |isbn=0-89573-614-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phenomenon was first identified in work done in the laboratories of [[Salvador Luria]] and Giuseppe Bertani in the early 1950s.&lt;ref name="Luria_Human_1952"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Luria SE, Human ML | title = A nonhereditary, host-induced variation of bacterial viruses | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | volume = 64 | issue = 4 | pages = 557–69 | date = Oct 1952 | pmid = 12999684 | pmc = 169391 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid13034700"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bertani G, Weigle JJ | title = Host controlled variation in bacterial viruses | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | volume = 65 | issue = 2 | pages = 113–21 | date = Feb 1953 | pmid = 13034700 | pmc = 169650 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was found that, for a bacteriophage λ that can grow well in one strain of ''Escherichia coli'', for example ''E. coli'' C, when grown in another strain, for example ''E. coli'' K, its yields can drop significantly, by as much as 3-5 orders of magnitude. The host cell, in this example ''E. coli'' K, is known as the restricting host and appears to have the ability to reduce the biological activity of the phage λ. If a phage becomes established in one strain, the ability of that phage to grow also becomes restricted in other strains. In the 1960s, it was shown in work done in the laboratories of [[Werner Arber]] and [[Matthew Meselson]] that the restriction is caused by an enzymatic cleavage of the phage DNA, and the enzyme involved was therefore termed a restriction enzyme.&lt;ref name="pmid4897066" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid4868368"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Meselson M, Yuan R | title = DNA restriction enzyme from E. coli | journal = Nature | volume = 217 | issue = 5134 | pages = 1110–4 | date = Mar 1968 | pmid = 4868368 | doi = 10.1038/2171110a0 | bibcode = 1968Natur.217.1110M }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid13888713"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dussoix D, Arber W | title = Host specificity of DNA produced by Escherichia coli.

The restriction enzymes studied by Arber and Meselson were type I restriction enzymes, which cleave DNA randomly away from the recognition site.&lt;ref name="pmid15840723"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Roberts RJ | title = How restriction enzymes became the workhorses of molecular biology | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 102 | issue = 17 | pages = 5905–8 | date = Apr 2005 | pmid = 15840723 | pmc = 1087929 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0500923102 | bibcode = 2005PNAS..102.5905R }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970, [[Hamilton O. Smith]], [[Thomas J.

Later, [[Daniel Nathans]] and Kathleen Danna showed that cleavage of [[simian virus 40]] (SV40) DNA by restriction enzymes yields specific fragments that can be separated using [[polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis]], thus showing that restriction enzymes can also be used for mapping DNA.&lt;ref name="pmid4332003"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Danna K, Nathans D | title = Specific cleavage of simian virus 40 DNA by restriction endonuclease of Hemophilus influenzae | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 68 | issue = 12 | pages = 2913–7 | date = Dec 1971 | pmid = 4332003 | pmc = 389558 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.68.12.2913 | bibcode = 1971PNAS...68.2913D }}&lt;/ref&gt; For their work in the discovery and characterization of restriction enzymes, the 1978 [[Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine]] was awarded to [[Werner Arber]], [[Daniel Nathans]], and [[Hamilton O. Smith]].&lt;ref name="urlMedicine 1978"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1978/ | title = The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine | year = 1978 | publisher = The Nobel Foundation | pages = | quote = for the discovery of restriction enzymes and their application to problems of molecular genetics | accessdate = 2008-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery of restriction enzymes allows DNA to be manipulated, leading to the development of [[recombinant DNA]] technology that has many applications, for example, allowing the large scale production of proteins such as human [[insulin]] used by [[diabetes|diabetics]].&lt;ref name="Luria_Human_1952"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid358198"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Villa-Komaroff L, Efstratiadis A, Broome S, Lomedico P, Tizard R, Naber SP, Chick WL, Gilbert W | title = A bacterial clone synthesizing proinsulin | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 75 | issue = 8 | pages = 3727–31 | date = Aug 1978 | pmid = 358198 | pmc = 392859 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.75.8.3727 | bibcode = 1978PNAS...75.3727V }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
Restriction enzymes likely evolved from a common ancestor and became widespread via [[horizontal gene transfer]].&lt;ref name="Jeltsch_1995"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jeltsch A, Kröger M, Pingoud A | title = Evidence for an evolutionary relationship among type-II restriction endonucleases | journal = Gene | volume = 160 | issue = 1 | pages = 7–16 | date = Jul 1995 | pmid = 7628720 | doi = 10.1016/0378-1119(95)00181-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jeltsch_1996"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jeltsch A, Pingoud A | title = Horizontal gene transfer contributes to the wide distribution and evolution of type II restriction-modification systems | journal = Journal of Molecular Evolution | volume = 42 | issue = 2 | pages = 91–6 | date = Feb 1996 | pmid = 8919860 | doi = 10.1007/BF02198833 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, there is mounting evidence that restriction endonucleases evolved as a [[Selfish DNA|selfish]] genetic element.&lt;ref name="Naito_1995"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Naito T, Kusano K, Kobayashi I | title = Selfish behavior of restriction-modification systems | journal = Science | volume = 267 | issue = 5199 | pages = 897–9 | date = Feb 1995 | pmid = 7846533 | doi = 10.1126/science.7846533 | bibcode = 1995Sci...267..897N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recognition site ==
[[File:EcoRV Restriction Site.rsh.svg|thumb|right|A palindromic recognition site reads the same on the reverse strand as it does on the forward strand when both are read in the same orientation]]
Restriction enzymes recognize a specific sequence of nucleotides&lt;ref name="pmid2172084"/&gt; and produce a double-stranded cut in the DNA. The recognition sequences can also be classified by the number of bases in its recognition site, usually between 4 and 8 bases, and the amount of bases in the sequence will determine how often the site will appear by chance in any given genome, e.g., a 4-base pair sequence would theoretically occur once every 4^4 or 256bp, 6 bases, 4^6 or 4,096bp, and 8 bases would be 4^8 or 65,536bp.&lt;ref name="http://bioweb.uwlax.edu/genweb/molecular/seq_anal/restriction_map/restriction_map.htm"&gt;[http://bioweb.uwlax.edu/genweb/molecular/seq_anal/restriction_map/restriction_map.htm Restriction Map&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Many of them are [[Palindromic sequence|palindromic]], meaning the base sequence reads the same backwards and forwards.&lt;ref name="pmid11557805"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pingoud A, Jeltsch A | title = Structure and function of type II restriction endonucleases | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 29 | issue = 18 | pages = 3705–27 | date = Sep 2001 | pmid = 11557805 | pmc = 55916 | doi = 10.1093/nar/29.18.3705 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In theory, there are two types of palindromic sequences that can be possible in DNA. The ''mirror-like'' palindrome is similar to those found in ordinary text, in which a sequence reads the same forward and backward on a single strand of DNA, as in GTAATG. The ''inverted repeat'' palindrome is also a sequence that reads the same forward and backward, but the forward and backward sequences are found in complementary DNA strands (i.e., of double-stranded DNA), as in GTATAC (GTATAC being [[Complementarity (molecular biology)|complementary]] to CATATG).&lt;ref name="isbn0-12-175551-7"&gt;{{cite book | author = Clark DP | title = Molecular biology | publisher = Elsevier Academic Press | location = Amsterdam | year = 2005 | pages = | isbn = 0-12-175551-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inverted repeat palindromes are more common and have greater biological importance than mirror-like palindromes.

[[EcoRI|''Eco''RI]] digestion produces [[Sticky and blunt ends|"sticky" ends]],

[[Image:EcoRI restriction enzyme recognition site.svg|90px]]

whereas [[SmaI]] restriction enzyme cleavage produces [[Sticky and blunt ends|"blunt" ends]]:

[[Image:SmaI restriction enzyme recognition site.svg|90px]]

Recognition sequences in DNA differ for each restriction enzyme, producing differences in the length, sequence and strand orientation ([[5' end]] or [[3' end]]) of a [[Sticky and blunt ends|sticky-end]] "overhang" of an enzyme restriction.&lt;ref name="pmid11897876"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Goodsell DS | title = The molecular perspective: restriction endonucleases | journal = Stem Cells | volume = 20 | issue = 2 | pages = 190–1 | year = 2002 | pmid = 11897876 | doi = 10.1634/stemcells.20-2-190 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Different restriction enzymes that recognize the same sequence are known as [[neoschizomer]]s. These often cleave in different locales of the sequence. Different enzymes that recognize and cleave in the same location are known as [[isoschizomer]]s.

== Types ==
Naturally occurring restriction endonucleases are categorized into four groups (Types I, II III, and IV) based on their composition and [[enzyme cofactor]] requirements, the nature of their target sequence, and the position of their DNA cleavage site relative to the target sequence.&lt;ref name="pmid8336674"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bickle TA, Krüger DH | title = Biology of DNA restriction | journal = Microbiological Reviews | volume = 57 | issue = 2 | pages = 434–50 | date = Jun 1993 | pmid = 8336674 | pmc = 372918 | doi =  | url = http://mmbr.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=8336674 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid4949033"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Boyer HW | title = DNA restriction and modification mechanisms in bacteria | journal = Annual Review of Microbiology | volume = 25 | issue =  | pages = 153–76 | year = 1971 | pmid = 4949033 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.mi.25.100171.001101 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid6267988"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yuan R | title = Structure and mechanism of multifunctional restriction endonucleases | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 50 | issue =  | pages = 285–319 | year = 1981 | pmid = 6267988 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.bi.50.070181.001441 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  DNA sequence analyses of restriction enzymes however show great variations, indicating that there are more than four types.&lt;ref name="neb"/&gt; All types of enzymes recognize specific short DNA sequences and carry out the endonucleolytic cleavage of DNA to give specific fragments with terminal 5'-phosphates.

* Type I enzymes ({{EC number|3.1.21.3}}) cleave at sites remote from a recognition site; require both ATP and S-adenosyl-L-methionine to function; multifunctional protein with both restriction and methylase ({{EC number|2.1.1.72}}) activities.
* Type II enzymes ({{EC number|3.1.21.4}}) cleave within or at short specific distances from a recognition site; most require magnesium; single function (restriction) enzymes independent of methylase.
* Type III enzymes ({{EC number|3.1.21.5}}) cleave at sites a short distance from a recognition site; require ATP (but do not hydrolyse it); S-adenosyl-L-methionine stimulates the reaction but is not required; exist as part of a complex with a modification methylase ({{EC number|2.1.1.72}}).
* Type IV enzymes target modified DNA, e.g. methylated, hydroxymethylated and glucosyl-hydroxymethylated DNA

=== Type l ===
Type I restriction enzymes were the first to be identified and were first identified in two different strains (K-12 and B) of ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]''.&lt;ref name="pmid10839821"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Murray NE | title = Type I restriction systems: sophisticated molecular machines (a legacy of Bertani and Weigle) | journal = Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews | volume = 64 | issue = 2 | pages = 412–34 | date = Jun 2000 | pmid = 10839821 | pmc = 98998 | doi = 10.1128/MMBR.64.2.412-434.2000 | url = http://mmbr.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=10839821 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These enzymes cut at a site that differs, and is a random distance (at least 1000 bp) away, from their recognition site. Cleavage at these random sites follows a process of DNA translocation, which shows that these enzymes are also molecular motors. The recognition site is asymmetrical and is composed of two specific portions—one containing 3–4 nucleotides, and another containing 4–5 nucleotides—separated by a non-specific spacer of about 6–8 nucleotides. These enzymes are multifunctional and are capable of both restriction and modification activities, depending upon the methylation status of the target DNA. The cofactors [[S-Adenosyl methionine]] (AdoMet), hydrolyzed adenosine triphosphate ([[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]), and [[magnesium]] (Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) [[ion]]s, are required for their full activity. Type I restriction enzymes possess three subunits called HsdR, HsdM, and HsdS; HsdR is required for restriction; HsdM is necessary for adding [[methyl]] groups to host DNA (methyltransferase activity), and HsdS is important for specificity of the recognition (DNA-binding) site in addition to both restriction (DNA cleavage) and modification (DNA methyltransferase) activity.&lt;ref name="pmid8336674"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid10839821"/&gt;

Typical type II restriction enzymes differ from type I restriction enzymes in several ways. They form [[homodimer]]s, with recognition sites that are usually undivided and palindromic and 4–8 nucleotides in length. They recognize and cleave DNA at the same site, and they do not use ATP or AdoMet for their activity—they usually require only Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; as a cofactor.&lt;ref name="pmid11557805"/&gt;  These enzymes cleave the phosphodiester bond of double helix DNA. It can either cleave at the center of both strands to yield a blunt end. Or it can cleave at a staggered position leaving overhands called sticky ends.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fundamental Laboratory Approaches for Biochemistry and Biotechnology|last=Ninfa J.|first=Alexander|last2=Balou|first2=David P.|last3=Benore|first3=Marilee|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2010|isbn=978-0-470-08766-4|location=Hoboken, NJ|pages=341}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are the most commonly available and used restriction enzymes. In the 1990s and early 2000s, new enzymes from this family were discovered that did not follow all the classical criteria of this enzyme class, and new subfamily [[nomenclature]] was developed to divide this large family into subcategories based on deviations from typical characteristics of type II enzymes.&lt;ref name="pmid11557805"/&gt; These subgroups are defined using a letter suffix.

Type IIB restriction enzymes (e.g., BcgI and BplI) are [[multimer]]s, containing more than one subunit.&lt;ref name="pmid11557805"/&gt; They cleave DNA on both sides of their recognition to cut out the recognition site. They require both AdoMet and Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; cofactors. Type IIE restriction endonucleases (e.g., NaeI) cleave DNA following interaction with two copies of their recognition sequence.&lt;ref name="pmid11557805"/&gt; One recognition site acts as the target for cleavage, while the other acts as an [[Allosteric regulation|allosteric effector]] that speeds up or improves the efficiency of enzyme cleavage. Similar to type IIE enzymes, type IIF restriction endonucleases (e.g. NgoMIV) interact with two copies of their recognition sequence but cleave both sequences at the same time.&lt;ref name="pmid11557805"/&gt; Type IIG restriction endonucleases (e.g., Eco57I) do have a single subunit, like classical Type II restriction enzymes, but require the cofactor AdoMet to be active.&lt;ref name="pmid11557805"/&gt; Type IIM restriction endonucleases, such as DpnI, are able to recognize and cut methylated DNA.&lt;ref name="pmid11557805"/&gt; Type IIS restriction endonucleases (e.g., ''Fok''I) cleave DNA at a defined distance from their non-palindromic asymmetric recognition sites;&lt;ref name="pmid11557805"/&gt; this characteristic is widely used to perform in-vitro cloning techniques such as [[Golden Gate Cloning|Golden Gate cloning]]. These enzymes may function as [[protein dimer|dimer]]s. Similarly, Type IIT restriction enzymes (e.g., Bpu10I and BslI) are composed of two different subunits. Some recognize palindromic sequences while others have asymmetric recognition sites.&lt;ref name="pmid11557805"/&gt;

=== Type III ===
Type III restriction enzymes (e.g., EcoP15) recognize two separate non-palindromic sequences that are inversely oriented. They cut DNA about 20–30 base pairs after the recognition site.&lt;ref name="pmid11557806"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dryden DT, Murray NE, Rao DN | title = Nucleoside triphosphate-dependent restriction enzymes | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 29 | issue = 18 | pages = 3728–41 | date = Sep 2001 | pmid = 11557806 | pmc = 55918 | doi = 10.1093/nar/29.18.3728 | url = http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=11557806 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These enzymes contain more than one subunit and require AdoMet and ATP cofactors for their roles in DNA methylation and restriction, respectively.&lt;ref name="pmid1734285"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Meisel A, Bickle TA, Krüger DH, Schroeder C | title = Type III restriction enzymes need two inversely oriented recognition sites for DNA cleavage | journal = Nature | volume = 355 | issue = 6359 | pages = 467–9 | date = Jan 1992 | pmid = 1734285 | doi = 10.1038/355467a0 | bibcode = 1992Natur.355..467M }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are components of [[Prokaryote|prokaryotic]] DNA restriction-modification [[Mechanism (biology)|mechanisms]] that protect the organism against invading foreign DNA. Type III enzymes are hetero-oligomeric, multifunctional [[protein]]s composed of two subunits, Res and Mod. The Mod subunit recognises the DNA sequence specific for the system and is a modification [[methyltransferase]]; as such, it is functionally equivalent to the M and S subunits of type I restriction endonuclease. Res is required for restriction, although it has no [[enzyme|enzymatic]] activity on its own. Type III enzymes recognise short 5–6 bp-long asymmetric DNA sequences and cleave 25–27 bp [[Upstream and downstream (DNA)|downstream]] to leave short, single-stranded 5' protrusions. They require the presence of two inversely oriented unmethylated recognition sites for restriction to occur. These enzymes [[DNA methylation|methylate]] only one strand of the DNA, at the N-6 position of adenosyl residues, so newly replicated DNA will have only one strand methylated, which is sufficient to protect against restriction. Type III enzymes belong to the beta-subfamily of [[DNA methyltransferase|N6 adenine methyltransferases]], containing the nine [[protein motif|motif]]s that characterise this family, including [[sequence motif|motif]] I, the [[S-adenosyl-L-methionine|AdoMet]] binding pocket (FXGXG), and motif IV, the [[catalytic]] region (S/D/N (PP) Y/F).&lt;ref name="pmid15121719"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid12595133"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bourniquel AA, Bickle TA | title = Complex restriction enzymes: NTP-driven molecular motors | journal = Biochimie | volume = 84 | issue = 11 | pages = 1047–59 | date = Nov 2002 | pmid = 12595133 | doi = 10.1016/S0300-9084(02)00020-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Type IV ===
Type IV enzymes recognize modified, typically methylated DNA and are exemplified by the&amp;nbsp;McrBC&amp;nbsp;and Mrr systems of&amp;nbsp;''E. coli''.&lt;ref name="neb"&gt;[https://www.neb.com/products/restriction-endonucleases/restriction-endonucleases/types-of-restriction-endonucleases Types of Restriction Endonucleases | NEB&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Type V===
Type V restriction enzymes (e.g., the cas9-gRNA complex from [[CRISPR]]s&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;) utilize guide RNAs to target specific non-palindromic sequences found on invading organisms. They can cut DNA of variable length, provided that a suitable guide RNA is provided.

=== Artificial restriction enzymes ===
Artificial restriction enzymes can be generated by fusing a natural or engineered [[DNA binding domain]] to a [[nuclease]] domain (often the cleavage domain of the type IIS restriction enzyme [[FokI|''Fok''I]]).&lt;ref name="kim1996"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kim YG, Cha J, Chandrasegaran S | title = Hybrid restriction enzymes: zinc finger fusions to Fok I cleavage domain | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 93 | issue = 3 | pages = 1156–60 | date = Feb 1996 | pmid = 8577732 | pmc = 40048 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.93.3.1156 | bibcode = 1996PNAS...93.1156K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such artificial restriction enzymes can target large DNA sites (up to 36 bp) and can be engineered to bind to desired DNA sequences.&lt;ref name="pmid20717154"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Urnov FD, Rebar EJ, Holmes MC, Zhang HS, Gregory PD | title = Genome editing with engineered zinc finger nucleases | journal = Nature Reviews Genetics | volume = 11 | issue = 9 | pages = 636–46 | date = Sep 2010 | pmid = 20717154 | doi = 10.1038/nrg2842 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zinc finger nucleases]] are the most commonly used artificial restriction enzymes and are generally used in [[genetic engineering]] applications,&lt;ref name="pmid19404258"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Townsend JA, Wright DA, Winfrey RJ, Fu F, Maeder ML, Joung JK, Voytas DF | title = High-frequency modification of plant genes using engineered zinc-finger nucleases | journal = Nature | volume = 459 | issue = 7245 | pages = 442–5 | date = May 2009 | pmid = 19404258 | pmc = 2743854 | doi = 10.1038/nature07845 | bibcode = 2009Natur.459..442T }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid19404259"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shukla VK, Doyon Y, Miller JC, DeKelver RC, Moehle EA, Worden SE, Mitchell JC, Arnold NL, Gopalan S, Meng X, Choi VM, Rock JM, Wu YY, Katibah GE, Zhifang G, McCaskill D, Simpson MA, Blakeslee B, Greenwalt SA, Butler HJ, Hinkley SJ, Zhang L, Rebar EJ, Gregory PD, Urnov FD | title = Precise genome modification in the crop species Zea mays using zinc-finger nucleases | journal = Nature | volume = 459 | issue = 7245 | pages = 437–41 | date = May 2009 | pmid = 19404259 | doi = 10.1038/nature07992 | bibcode = 2009Natur.459..437S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid18554175"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ekker SC | title = Zinc finger-based knockout punches for zebrafish genes | journal = Zebrafish | volume = 5 | issue = 2 | pages = 121–3 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18554175 | pmc = 2849655 | doi = 10.1089/zeb.2008.9988 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid19628861"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Geurts AM, Cost GJ, Freyvert Y, Zeitler B, Miller JC, Choi VM, Jenkins SS, Wood A, Cui X, Meng X, Vincent A, Lam S, Michalkiewicz M, Schilling R, Foeckler J, Kalloway S, Weiler H, Ménoret S, Anegon I, Davis GD, Zhang L, Rebar EJ, Gregory PD, Urnov FD, Jacob HJ, Buelow R | title = Knockout rats via embryo microinjection of zinc-finger nucleases | journal = Science | volume = 325 | issue = 5939 | page = 433 | date = Jul 2009 | pmid = 19628861 | pmc = 2831805 | doi = 10.1126/science.1172447 | bibcode = 2009Sci...325..433G }}&lt;/ref&gt; but can also be used for more standard [[gene cloning]] applications.&lt;ref name="pmid21029755"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tovkach A, Zeevi V, Tzfira T | title = Expression, purification and characterization of cloning-grade zinc finger nuclease | journal = Journal of Biotechnology | volume = 151 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–8 | date = Jan 2011 | pmid = 21029755 | doi = 10.1016/j.jbiotec.2010.10.071 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other artificial restriction enzymes are based on the DNA binding domain of [[TAL effector]]s.&lt;ref name="pmid20660643"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Christian M, Cermak T, Doyle EL, Schmidt C, Zhang F, Hummel A, Bogdanove AJ, Voytas DF | title = Targeting DNA double-strand breaks with TAL effector nucleases | journal = Genetics | volume = 186 | issue = 2 | pages = 757–61 | date = Oct 2010 | pmid = 20660643 | pmc = 2942870 | doi = 10.1534/genetics.110.120717 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid20699274"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Li T, Huang S, Jiang WZ, Wright D, Spalding MH, Weeks DP, Yang B | title = TAL nucleases (TALNs): hybrid proteins composed of TAL effectors and FokI DNA-cleavage domain | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 39 | issue = 1 | pages = 359–372 | date = Jan 2011 | pmid = 20699274 | pmc = 3017587 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkq704 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Artificial ribonucleases that act as restriction enzymes for RNA are also being developed. A [[Peptide nucleic acid|PNA]]-based system, called PNAzymes, has a Cu(II)-[[Neocuproine|2,9-dimethylphenanthroline]] group that mimics ribonucleases for specific RNA sequence and cleaves at a non-base-paired region (RNA bulge) of the targeted RNA formed when the enzyme binds the RNA. This enzyme shows selectivity by cleaving only at one site that either does not have a mismatch or is kinetically preferred out of two possible cleavage sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Merita Murtola, Malgorzata Wenska and Roger Stromberg|title=PNAzymes That Are Artificial RNA Restriction Enzymes|url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja1008739 |journal=J.

==Applications==
{{main|Restriction digest}}
Isolated restriction enzymes are used to manipulate DNA for different scientific applications.

They are used to assist insertion of genes into [[plasmid]] [[Plasmid vector|vector]]s during [[gene cloning]] and [[protein production]] experiments. For optimal use, plasmids that are commonly used for gene cloning are modified to include a short ''polylinker'' sequence (called the [[multiple cloning site]], or MCS) rich in restriction enzyme recognition sequences. This allows flexibility when inserting gene fragments into the plasmid vector; restriction sites contained naturally within genes influence the choice of endonuclease for digesting the DNA, since it is necessary to avoid restriction of wanted DNA while intentionally cutting the ends of the DNA. To clone a gene fragment into a vector, both plasmid DNA and gene insert are typically cut with the same restriction enzymes, and then glued together with the assistance of an enzyme known as a [[DNA ligase]].&lt;ref name="urlCloning using restriction enzymes"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.embl.de/pepcore/pepcore_services/cloning/cloning_methods/restriction_enzymes/ | title = Cloning using restriction enzymes | author = Geerlof A | publisher = European Molecular Biology Laboratory - Hamburg | accessdate = 2008-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="isbn0-87969-576-5"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Russell DW, Sambrook J | title = Molecular cloning: a laboratory manual | edition = | publisher = Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory | location = Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y | year = 2001 | isbn = 0-87969-576-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Restriction enzymes can also be used to distinguish gene [[allele]]s by specifically recognizing single base changes in DNA known as [[single nucleotide polymorphism]]s (SNPs).&lt;ref name="pmid18330346"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wolff JN, Gemmell NJ | title = Combining allele-specific fluorescent probes and restriction assay in real-time PCR to achieve SNP scoring beyond allele ratios of 1:1000 | journal = BioTechniques | volume = 44 | issue = 2 | pages = 193–4, 196, 199 | date = Feb 2008 | pmid = 18330346 | doi = 10.2144/000112719 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid15980518"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang R, Zhu Z, Zhu H, Nguyen T, Yao F, Xia K, Liang D, Liu C | title = SNP Cutter: a comprehensive tool for SNP PCR-RFLP assay design | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 33 | issue = Web Server issue | pages = W489–92 | date = Jul 2005 | pmid = 15980518 | pmc = 1160119 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gki358 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is however only possible if a SNP alters the restriction site present in the allele. In this method, the restriction enzyme can be used to [[genotype]] a DNA sample without the need for expensive [[DNA sequencing|gene sequencing]]. The sample is first digested with the restriction enzyme to generate DNA fragments, and then the different sized fragments separated by [[gel electrophoresis]]. In general, alleles with correct restriction sites will generate two visible bands of DNA on the gel, and those with altered restriction sites will not be cut and will generate only a single band. A [[restriction map|DNA map]] by restriction digest can also be generated that can give the relative positions of the genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nature.com/scitable/definition/mapping-282 |title=Mapping |work=Nature }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The  different lengths of DNA generated by restriction digest also produce a specific pattern of bands after gel electrophoresis, and can be used for [[DNA fingerprinting]].

In a similar manner, restriction enzymes are used to digest [[genomic]] DNA for gene analysis by [[Southern blot]]. This technique allows researchers to identify how many copies (or [[paralogue]]s) of a gene are present in the genome of one individual, or how many gene [[mutation]]s ([[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphisms]]) have occurred within a population. The latter example is called [[Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism|restriction fragment length polymorphism]] (RFLP).&lt;ref name="isbn0-7167-4684-0"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Stryer L, Berg JM, Tymoczko JL | title = Biochemistry | edition = Fifth | publisher = W.H.

Artificial restriction enzymes created by linking the ''Fok''I DNA cleavage domain with an array of DNA binding proteins or zinc finger arrays, denoted zinc finger nucleases (ZFN), are a powerful tool for host genome editing due to their enhanced sequence specificity. ZFN work in pairs, their dimerization being mediated in-situ through the ''Fok''I domain. Each zinc finger array (ZFA) is capable of recognizing 9–12 base pairs, making for 18–24 for the pair. A 5–7 bp spacer between the cleavage sites further enhances the specificity of ZFN, making them a safe and more precise tool that can be applied in humans. A recent Phase I clinical trial of ZFN for the targeted abolition of the CCR5 co-receptor for HIV-1 has been undertaken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tebas P, Stein D, Tang WW, Frank I, Wang SQ, Lee G, Spratt SK, Surosky RT, Giedlin MA, Nichol G, Holmes MC, Gregory PD, Ando DG, Kalos M, Collman RG, Binder-Scholl G, Plesa G, Hwang WT, Levine BL, June CH | title = Gene editing of CCR5 in autologous CD4 T cells of persons infected with HIV | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 370 | issue = 10 | pages = 901–910 | date = Mar 2014 | pmid = 24597865 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa1300662 | pmc=4084652}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have proposed using the bacteria R-M system as a model for devising human anti-viral gene or genomic vaccines and therapies since the RM system serves an innate defense-role in bacteria by restricting tropism by bacteriophages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Wayengera M |title= HIV and Gene Therapy: The proposed [R-M enzymatic] model for a gene therapy against HIV. |journal=Makerere Med J. |year=2003 |volume=38 |pages=28–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is research on REases and ZFN that can cleave the DNA of various human viruses, including [[Herpes simplex virus|HSV-2]], high-risk [[HPV]]s and [[HIV-1]], with the ultimate goal of inducing target mutagenesis and aberrations of human-infecting viruses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wayengera M, Kajumbula H, Byarugaba W |title= Frequency and site mapping of HIV-1/SIVcpz, HIV-2/SIVsmm and Other SIV gene sequence cleavage by various bacteria restriction enzymes: Precursors for a novel HIV inhibitory product |journal= Afr J Biotechnol |year=2007 |volume= 6 |issue=10 |pages=1225–1232 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schiffer JT, Aubert M, Weber ND, Mintzer E, Stone D, Jerome KR | title = Targeted DNA mutagenesis for the cure of chronic viral infections | journal = Journal of Virology | volume = 86 | issue = 17 | pages = 8920–36 | date = Sep 2012 | pmid = 22718830 | pmc = 3416169 | doi = 10.1128/JVI.00052-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Manjunath N, Yi G, Dang Y, Shankar P | title = Newer gene editing technologies toward HIV gene therapy | journal = Viruses | volume = 5 | issue = 11 | pages = 2748–66 | date = Nov 2013 | pmid = 24284874 | pmc = 3856413 | doi = 10.3390/v5112748 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Interestingly, the human genome already contains remnants of retroviral genomes that have been inactivated and harnessed for self-gain.
