'''Gene therapy''' is the therapeutic delivery of [[nucleic acid]] [[polymers]] into a patient's cells as a [[Biologic medical product|drug]] to treat disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Emerging Medical Technologies|last=Ermak|first=Gennady|publisher=World Scientific|year=2015|isbn=978-981-4675-81-9|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first attempt at modifying human DNA was performed in 1980 by [[Martin Cline]], but the first successful nuclear gene transfer in humans, approved by the [[National Institutes of Health]], was performed in May 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=2381442 | doi=10.1056/NEJM199008303230904 | volume=323 | issue=9 | title=Gene transfer into humans--immunotherapy of patients with advanced melanoma, using tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes modified by retroviral gene transduction | date=August 1990 |vauthors=Rosenberg SA, Aebersold P, Cornetta K | journal=N.

==Background==

Gene therapy was conceptualized in 1972, by authors who urged caution before commencing human gene therapy studies.

The first attempt, an unsuccessful one, at gene therapy (as well as the first case of medical transfer of foreign genes into humans not counting [[organ transplantation]]) was performed by [[Martin Cline]] on 10 July 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Human gene therapy|publisher=DIANE Publishing|isbn=9781428923713|url=https://books.google.com/?id=FxGjBqEL-3kC&amp;pg=PA45}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=7123214 | volume=218 | issue=4567 | title=Martin Cline loses appeal on NIH grant | year=1982 | journal=Science | page=37 | doi=10.1126/science.7123214 | author=Sun M}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cline claimed that one of the genes in his patients was active six months later, though he never published this data or had it verified&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FzuwRwb--X4C&amp;pg=PA30|title=A Companion to Genethics|editors=Justine Burley, John Harris|isbn=9780470756379|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and even if he is correct, it's unlikely it produced any significant beneficial effects treating [[beta-thalassemia]].

After extensive research on animals throughout the 1980s and a 1989 bacterial gene tagging trial on humans, the first gene therapy widely accepted as a success was demonstrated in a trial that started on 14 September 1990, when Ashi DeSilva was treated for [[adenosine deaminase deficiency|ADA]]-[[severe combined immunodeficiency|SCID]].&lt;ref name="Gene Therapy Finds Its Niche"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Sheridan C | title = Gene therapy finds its niche | journal = Nature Biotechnology | volume = 29 | issue = 2 | pages = 121–128 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21301435 | doi = 10.1038/nbt.1769 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first somatic treatment that produced a permanent genetic change was performed in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Clinical Trials of Gene Therapy for ADA-Deficent SCID|author=Kohn, Donald B.|url=http://www.asgct.org/UserFiles/kohnslides.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This procedure was referred to sensationally and somewhat inaccurately in the media as a "three parent baby", though mtDNA is not the primary human genome and has little effect on an organism's individual characteristics beyond powering their cells.

Gene therapy is a way to fix a genetic problem at its source. The polymers are either [[translation (biology)|translated]] into [[proteins]], interfere with target [[gene expression]], or possibly correct [[genetic mutations]].

The most common form uses [[DNA]] that encodes a functional, therapeutic [[gene]] to replace a [[mutate]]d gene.  The polymer molecule is packaged within a "[[Vector (molecular biology)|vector]]", which carries the molecule inside cells.

Early clinical failures led to dismissals of gene therapy. Clinical successes since 2006 regained researchers' attention, although as of 2014, it was still largely an experimental technique.&lt;ref name="Richards2012" /&gt; These include treatment of [[retinal diseases]] [[Leber's congenital amaurosis]]&lt;ref name="Maguire 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Simonelli 2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cideciyan 2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bainbridge 2008" /&gt; and [[choroideremia]],&lt;ref name="BBC2016"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ghosh|first1=Pallab|title=Gene therapy reverses sight loss and is long-lasting|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-36101786|accessdate=29 April 2016|publisher=BBC News, Science &amp; Environment|date=28 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[x-linked severe combined immunodeficiency|X-linked SCID]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Fischer | first1 = A. | last2 = Hacein-Bey-Abina | first2 = S. | last3 = Cavazzana-Calvo | first3 = M. | doi = 10.1038/ni0610-457 | title = 20 years of gene therapy for SCID | journal = Nature Immunology | volume = 11 | issue = 6 | pages = 457–460 | year = 2010 | pmid =  20485269| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; ADA-SCID,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ferrua | first1 = F. | last2 = Brigida | first2 = I. | last3 = Aiuti | first3 = A. | doi = 10.1097/ACI.0b013e32833fea85 | title = Update on gene therapy for adenosine deaminase-deficient severe combined immunodeficiency | journal = Current Opinion in Allergy and Clinical Immunology | volume = 10 | issue = 6 | pages = 551–556 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20966749 | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NewScientist1013" /&gt; [[adrenoleukodystrophy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Cartier N|author2= Aubourg P | title = Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation and Hematopoietic Stem Cell Gene Therapy in X-Linked Adrenoleukodystrophy | journal = Brain Pathology | volume = 20 | issue = 4 | pages = 857–862 | year = 2009 | pmid = 20626747 | doi = 10.1111/j.1750-3639.2010.00394.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[chronic lymphocytic leukemia]] (CLL),&lt;ref name="Porter" /&gt; [[acute lymphocytic leukemia]] (ALL),&lt;ref name="SloanKettering" /&gt; [[multiple myeloma]],&lt;ref name="Adaptimmune"&gt;Coghlan, Andy (11 December 2013) [http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn22613-soupedup-immune-cells-force-leukaemia-into-remission.html Souped-up immune cells force leukaemia into remission].

==Approaches==
Following early advances in [[genetic engineering]] of bacteria, cells, and small animals, scientists started considering how to apply it to medicine. Two main approaches were considered – replacing or disrupting defective genes.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. National Library of Medicine, Genomics Home Reference. [http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/handbook/therapy/genetherapy What is gene therapy?]&lt;/ref&gt;  Scientists focused on diseases caused by single-gene defects, such as [[cystic fibrosis]], [[haemophilia]], [[muscular dystrophy]], [[thalassemia]] and [[sickle cell anemia]]. [[Glybera]] treats one such disease, caused by a defect in [[lipoprotein lipase]].&lt;ref name=Gallagher/&gt;

[[DNA]] must be administered, reach the damaged cells, enter the cell and either express or disrupt a protein.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. National Library of Medicine, Genomics Home Reference. [http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/handbook/therapy/procedures How does gene therapy work?]&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple delivery techniques have been explored. The initial approach incorporated DNA into an engineered [[virus]] to deliver the DNA into a [[chromosome]].&lt;ref name="pmid23015375"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.5301/JABFM.2012.9707| title =  We still have a long way to go to effectively deliver genes!| journal = Journal of Applied Biomaterials &amp; Functional Materials| volume = 10| issue = 2| pages = 82–91| year = 2012| last1 = Pezzoli | first1 = D. | last2 = Chiesa | first2 = R. | last3 = De Nardo | first3 = L. | last4 = Candiani | first4 = G. | pmid=23015375}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid23435812"&gt;{{Cite journal | pmid = 23435812| year = 2013| author1 = Vannucci| first1 = L| title = Viral vectors: A look back and ahead on gene transfer technology| journal = The New Microbiologica| volume = 36| issue = 1| pages = 1–22| last2 = Lai| first2 = M| last3 = Chiuppesi| first3 = F| last4 = Ceccherini-Nelli| first4 = L| last5 = Pistello| first5 = M}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Naked DNA]] approaches have also been explored, especially in the context of [[vaccine]] development.&lt;ref name="pmid23111168"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gothelf A|author2= Gehl J | title = What you always needed to know about electroporation based DNA vaccines | journal = Hum Vaccin Immunother | volume = 8 | issue = 11 | pages = 1694–702 | year = 2012 | pmid = 23111168 | pmc = 3601144 | doi = 10.4161/hv.22062 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, efforts focused on administering a gene that causes a needed protein to be expressed. More recently, increased understanding of [[nucleases|nuclease]] function has led to more direct DNA editing, using techniques such as [[zinc finger nucleases]] and [[CRISPR]]. The vector incorporates genes into chromosomes. The expressed nucleases then knock out and replace genes in the chromosome. As of 2014 these approaches involve removing cells from patients, editing a chromosome and returning the transformed cells to patients.&lt;ref name="pmid20717154"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Urnov | first1 = Fyodor D. | last2 = Rebar | first2 = Edward J. | last3 = Holmes | first3 = Michael C. | last4 = Zhang | first4 = H.

[[Image:CRISPR-Cas9 mode of action.png|thumb|500px|A duplex of crRNA and [[Trans-activating crRNA|tracrRNA]] acts as guide RNA to introduce a specifically located gene modification based on the RNA 5’ upstream of the crRNA. Cas9 binds the tracrRNA and needs a DNA binding sequence (5’NGG3’), which is called protospacer adjacent motif (PAM). After binding, Cas9 introduces a DNA double strand break, which is then followed by gene modification via homologous recombination (HDR) or non-homologous end joining (NHEJ).]]

==Cell types==
Gene therapy may be classified into two types:

===Somatic===
In [[somatic cell]] gene therapy (SCGT), the therapeutic genes are transferred into any cell other than a [[gamete]], [[germ cell]], [[gametocyte]] or undifferentiated [[stem cell]]. Any such modifications affect the individual patient only, and are not inherited by [[offspring]]. Somatic gene therapy represents mainstream basic and clinical research, in which therapeutic DNA (either integrated in the [[genome]] or as an external [[episome]] or [[plasmid]]) is used to treat disease.

Over 600 [[clinical trials]] utilizing SCGT are underway in the US. Most focus on severe genetic disorders, including [[Primary immunodeficiency|immunodeficiencies]], [[haemophilia]], [[Thalassemia|thalassaemia]] and [[cystic fibrosis]]. Such single gene disorders are good candidates for somatic cell therapy. The complete correction of a genetic disorder or the replacement of multiple genes is not yet possible. Only a few of the trials are in the advanced stages.&lt;ref name="somatic"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Mavilio F|author2= Ferrari G | title = Genetic modification of somatic stem cells. The progress, problems and prospects of a new therapeutic technology | journal = EMBO Rep. | volume = 9 Suppl 1 | pages = S64–9 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18578029 | pmc = 3327547 | doi = 10.1038/embor.2008.81 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germline===
In [[germline]] gene therapy (GGT), [[germ cell]]s ([[sperm]] or [[eggs]]) are modified by the introduction of functional genes into their genomes. Modifying a germ cell causes all the organism's cells to contain the modified gene. The change is therefore [[heritable]] and passed on to later generations.

==Vectors==
{{Main|Vectors in gene therapy}}

The delivery of DNA into cells can be accomplished by multiple [[Vectors in Gene Therapy|methods]]. The two major classes are [[recombinant virus]]es (sometimes called biological nanoparticles or viral vectors) and [[naked DNA]] or DNA complexes (non-viral methods).

===Viruses===
{{Main|Viral vector}}
In order to [[Viral replication|replicate]], [[virus]]es introduce their genetic material into the host cell, tricking the host's cellular machinery into using it as blueprints for viral proteins. [[Retrovirus|Retroviruses]] go a stage further by having their genetic material copied into the genome of the host cell.  Scientists exploit this by substituting a virus's genetic material with therapeutic DNA. (The term 'DNA' may be an oversimplification, as some viruses contain RNA, and gene therapy could take this form as well.) A number of viruses have been used for human gene therapy, including [[retrovirus|retroviruses]], [[adenovirus|adenoviruses]], [[herpes simplex virus|herpes simplex]], [[vaccinia virus|vaccinia]] and [[adeno-associated virus]].&lt;ref name="JGenMed Database" /&gt; Like the genetic material (DNA or RNA) in viruses, therapeutic DNA can be designed to simply serve as a temporary blueprint that is degraded naturally or (at least theoretically) to enter the host's genome, becoming a permanent part of the host's DNA in infected cells.

=== Non-viral ===
Non-viral methods present certain advantages over viral methods, such as large scale production and low host [[immunogenicity]]. However, non-viral methods initially produced lower levels of [[transfection]] and [[gene expression]], and thus lower therapeutic efficacy. Later technology remedied this deficiency{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}.

[[Vectors in Gene Therapy#Non-viral methods|Methods for non-viral gene therapy]] include the injection of naked DNA, [[electroporation]], the [[gene gun]], [[sonoporation]], [[magnetofection]], the use of [[oligonucleotide]]s, lipoplexes, dendrimers, and inorganic nanoparticles.

==Hurdles==
Some of the unsolved problems include:
*Short-lived nature – Before gene therapy can become a permanent cure for a condition, the therapeutic DNA introduced into target cells must remain functional and the cells containing the therapeutic DNA must be stable. Problems with integrating therapeutic DNA into the [[genome]] and the rapidly dividing nature of many cells prevent it from achieving long-term benefits. Patients require multiple treatments.
*Immune response – Any time a foreign object is introduced into human tissues, the immune system is stimulated to attack the invader. Stimulating the immune system in a way that reduces gene therapy effectiveness is possible. The [[immune system]]'s enhanced response to viruses that it has seen before reduces the effectiveness to repeated treatments.
*Problems with viral vectors – Viral vectors carry the risks of toxicity, inflammatory responses, and gene control and targeting issues. 
*Multigene disorders – Some commonly occurring disorders, such as [[heart disease]], [[high blood pressure]], [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[arthritis]], and [[diabetes]], are affected by variations in multiple genes, which complicate gene therapy.
*Some therapies may breach the [[Weismann barrier]] (between soma and germ-line) protecting the testes, potentially modifying the germline, falling afoul of regulations in countries that prohibit the latter practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wasdarwinwrong.com/kortho39a.htm |title=The implications of Steele's soma-to-germline feedback for human gene therapy |author=Korthof G}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Insertional [[mutagenesis]] – If the DNA is integrated in a sensitive spot in the genome, for example in a [[tumor suppressor gene]], the therapy could induce a [[tumor]]. This has occurred in clinical trials for [[X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency]] (X-SCID) patients, in which [[hematopoietic]] stem cells were transduced with a corrective transgene using a [[retrovirus]], and this led to the development of [[T cell leukemia]] in 3 of 20 patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Woods | first1 = N.

This therapy also represents the beginning of cancer immunogene therapy, a treatment which proves to be effective due to the anti-tumor mechanism of IGF-I antisense, which is related to strong immune and apoptotic phenomena.

In 1992 [[Claudio Bordignon]], working at the [[Vita-Salute San Raffaele University]], performed the first gene therapy procedure using [[hematopoietic stem cell]]s as vectors to deliver genes intended to correct [[hereditary diseases]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Abbott A | title = Gene therapy.

The success of a multi-center trial for treating children with SCID ([[severe combined immune deficiency]] or "bubble boy" disease) from 2000 and 2002, was questioned when two of the ten children treated at the trial's Paris center developed a leukemia-like condition.

In 1993 Andrew Gobea was born with SCID following prenatal [[genetic screening]]. Blood was removed from his mother's [[placenta]] and [[umbilical cord]] immediately after birth, to acquire stem cells. The [[allele]] that codes for [[adenosine deaminase]] (ADA) was obtained and inserted into a retrovirus. Retroviruses and stem cells were mixed, after which the viruses inserted the gene into the stem cell chromosomes. Stem cells containing the working ADA gene were injected into Andrew's blood. Injections of the ADA enzyme were also given weekly. For four years [[T cell]]s (white blood cells), produced by stem cells, made ADA enzymes using the ADA gene. After four years more treatment was needed.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

[[Jesse Gelsinger]]'s death in 1999 impeded gene therapy research in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/10/11/AR2010101102946.html |title=First patient treated in stem cell study |work=The Washington Post |date= 11 October 2010 |author=Stein, Rob|accessdate=10 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medpagetoday.com/Genetics/GeneralGenetics/6275 |title=Death Prompts FDA to Suspend Arthritis Gene Therapy Trial |publisher=Medpage Today |date= 27 July 2007 |accessdate=10 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the FDA suspended several clinical trials pending the reevaluation of ethical and procedural practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/22/us/gene-therapy-ordered-halted-at-university.html|author=Stolberg, Sheryl Gay|title=Gene Therapy Ordered Halted At University |work=The New York Times |date=22 January 2000 |accessdate=10 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2000s===
The modified cancer gene therapy strategy of antisense IGF-I RNA (NIH n˚ 1602)&lt;ref name="pmid22400112" /&gt; using  antisense / triple helix anti IGF-I approach was registered in 2002 by Wiley gene therapy clinical trial - n˚ 635 and 636. The approach has shown promising results in the treatment of six different malignant tumors: glioblastoma, cancers of liver, colon, prostate, uterus and ovary (Collaborative NATO Science Programme on Gene Therapy USA, France, Poland n˚ LST 980517 conducted by J. Trojan) (Trojan et al., 2012). This anti–gene antisense/triple helix therapy has proven to be efficient, due to the mechanism stopping simultaneously IGF-I expression on translation and transcription levels, strengthening anti-tumor immune and apoptotic phenomena.

Possible regulatory schemes include a complete ban, provision to everyone, or professional self-regulation. The [[American Medical Association]]’s Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs stated that "genetic interventions to enhance traits should be considered permissible only in severely restricted situations: (1) clear and meaningful benefits to the fetus or child; (2) no trade-off with other characteristics or traits; and (3) equal access to the genetic technology, irrespective of income or other socioeconomic characteristics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=7921302|year=1994|title=Ethical issues related to prenatal genetic testing.

As early in the history of [[biotechnology]] as 1990, there have been scientists opposed to attempts to modify the human [[germline]] using these new tools,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20010805085535/http://www.cioms.ch/frame_1990_texts_of_guidelines.htm The Declaration of Inuyama: Human Genome Mapping, Genetic Screening and Gene Therapy]. cioms.ch&lt;/ref&gt; and such concerns have continued as technology progressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Smith KR, Chan S, Harris J |title= Human germline genetic modification: scientific and bioethical perspectives|journal= Archives of Medical Research|volume= 43|issue= 7|pages= 491–513|pmid= 23072719|year= 2012|doi= 10.1016/j.arcmed.2012.09.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Reardon | first1 = Sara | name-list-format = vanc | title = US science advisers outline path to genetically modified babies | url = http://www.nature.com/news/us-science-advisers-outline-path-to-genetically-modified-babies-1.21474 | journal = Nature | date =  14 February 2017 | doi = 10.1038/nature.2017.21474|doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the advent of new techniques like [[CRISPR]], in March 2015 a group of scientists urged a worldwide moratorium on clinical use of gene editing technologies to edit the [[human genome]] in a way that can be inherited.&lt;ref name="NYT-20150319"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20150303-AP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SCI-20150319" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NAT-20150312"/&gt;  In April 2015, researchers sparked controversy when they  [[CRISPR#Society and culture|reported]] results of [[basic research]] to edit the [[DNA]] of non-viable [[human embryos]] using CRISPR.&lt;ref name="PC-20150418"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Liang, Puping|title=CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing in human tripronuclear zygotes|date=18 April 2015 |journal=[[Protein &amp; Cell]] |doi=10.1007/s13238-015-0153-5 |display-authors=etal |volume=6 |issue=5 |pages=363–372 |pmid=25894090 |pmc=4417674}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20150423"&gt;{{cite news |last=Kolata |first=Gina |title=Chinese Scientists Edit Genes of Human Embryos, Raising Concerns |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/24/health/chinese-scientists-edit-genes-of-human-embryos-raising-concerns.html |date=23 April 2015 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=24 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A committee of the American [[National Academy of Sciences]] and [[National Academy of Medicine]] gave qualified support to human genome editing in 2017&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/14/health/human-gene-editing-panel.html|title=Human Gene Editing Receives Science Panel’s Support|last=Harmon|first=Amy|date=2017-02-14|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=2017-02-17|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Committee on Human Gene Editing: Scientific, Medical, and Ethical Considerations|title=Human Genome Editing: Science, Ethics, and Governance|url=http://nationalacademies.org/gene-editing/consensus-study/index.htm|website=nationalacademies.org|publisher=National Academy of Sciences; National Academy of Medicine|accessdate=21 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; once answers have been found to safety and efficiency problems "but only for serious conditions under stringent oversight."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nypost.com/2017/02/14/scientists-ok-genetically-engineering-babies/|title=Scientists OK genetically engineering babies|last=|first=|date=2017-02-14|website=New York Post|publisher=Reuters|access-date=2017-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulations==

Regulations covering genetic modification are part of general guidelines about human-involved biomedical research.

The [[Declaration of Helsinki|Helsinki Declaration]] (Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects) was amended by the [[World Medical Association]]'s General Assembly in 2008. This document provides principles physicians and researchers must consider when involving humans as research subjects. The Statement on Gene Therapy Research initiated by the [[Human Genome Organization]] (HUGO) in 2001 provides a legal baseline for all countries. HUGO’s document emphasizes human freedom and adherence to human rights, and offers recommendations for somatic gene therapy, including the importance of recognizing public concerns about such research.&lt;ref name="human genome"&gt;Human Genome Organization. HUGO Ethics Committee (April 2001). [https://web.archive.org/web/20080907065932/http://www.hugo-international.org/img/gene_2001.pdf Statement on Gene Therapy Research].&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
No federal legislation lays out protocols or restrictions about human genetic engineering. This subject is governed by overlapping regulations from local and federal agencies, including the [[Department of Health and Human Services]], the FDA and NIH's Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee. Researchers seeking federal funds for an investigational new drug application, (commonly the case for somatic human genetic engineering), must obey international and federal guidelines for the protection of human subjects.&lt;ref name="regulatory"&gt;Isasi, R. M. et al. (October 2006) [http://www.dnapolicy.org/pdf/geneticModification.pdf National Regulatory Frameworks Regarding Human Genetic Modification Technologies (Somatic and Germline Modification)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140917192159/http://www.dnapolicy.org/pdf/geneticModification.pdf |date=17 September 2014 }}. Genetics &amp; Public Policy Center.&lt;/ref&gt;

NIH serves as the main gene therapy regulator for federally funded research. Privately funded research is advised to follow these regulations. NIH provides funding for research that develops or enhances genetic engineering techniques and to evaluate the ethics and quality in current research. The NIH maintains a mandatory registry of human genetic engineering research protocols that includes all federally funded projects.

An NIH advisory committee published a set of guidelines on gene manipulation.&lt;ref name="national"&gt;National Institutes of Health. [http://osp.od.nih.gov/office-biotechnology-activities/biosafety/nih-guidelines NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules]. Revised April 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The guidelines discuss lab safety as well as human test subjects and various experimental types that involve genetic changes. Several sections specifically pertain to human genetic engineering, including Section III-C-1. This section describes required review processes and other aspects when seeking approval to begin clinical research involving genetic transfer into a human patient.&lt;ref name="us"&gt;U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services. The National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research. [http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/guidance/belmont.html The Belmont Report: Ethical Principles and Guidelines for the Protection of Human Subjects of Research]. 18 April 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;  The protocol for a gene therapy clinical trial must be approved by the NIH's Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee prior to any clinical trial beginning; this is different from any other kind of clinical trial.&lt;ref name="national"/&gt;
 
As with other kinds of drugs, the FDA regulates the quality and safety of gene therapy products and supervises how these products are used clinically. Therapeutic alteration of the human genome falls under the same regulatory requirements as any other medical treatment. Research involving human subjects, such as [[clinical trials]], must be reviewed and approved by the FDA and an [[Institutional Review Board]].&lt;ref name="fda2"&gt;{{cite journal|author=U.S. Food and Drug Administration|title= Application of Current Statutory Authorities to Human Somatic Cell Therapy Products and Gene Therapy Products|journal= Federal Register|volume=58|issue= 197|date=14 October 1993|url=http://www.fda.gov/downloads/BiologicsBloodVaccines/SafetyAvailability/UCM148113.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="health"&gt;U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
