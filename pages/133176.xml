[[File:A lipid micelle.png|thumb|[[Schematic]] diagram of a [[micelle]] of oil in aqueous suspension, such as might occur in an [[emulsion]] of oil in water. In this example the surfactant molecules' oil-soluble tails project into the oil (blue), while the water-soluble ends remain in contact with the water phase (red).]]

'''Surfactants''' are compounds that lower the [[surface tension]] (or interfacial tension) between two liquids or between a liquid and a solid. Surfactants may act as [[detergent]]s, [[wetting]] agents, [[emulsion#Emulsifiers|emulsifiers]], [[foaming agent]]s, and [[dispersant]]s.

==Etymology and definition==
The term ''surfactant'' is a [[Blend word|blend]] of ''surface active agent''.&lt;ref name="Rosen MJ"&gt;{{Cite book|vauthors=Rosen MJ, Kunjappu JT|lastauthoramp=yes |title= Surfactants and Interfacial Phenomena |edition=4th |year=2012|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1rCdNIzB78AC&amp;printsec=frontcover|isbn=1-118-22902-9 |location=Hoboken, New Jersey |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States National Library of Medicine]]'s [[Medical Subject Headings|Medical Subject Headings (MeSH)]] vocabulary, ''surfactant'' is reserved for the meaning [[pulmonary surfactant]]. For the more general meaning, ''surface active agent/s'' is the heading.

[[Image:Micelle scheme-en.svg|thumb|right|[[Schematic]] diagram of a [[micelle]]&amp;nbsp;– the [[lipophilic]] tails of the surfactant ions remain inside the oil because they interact more strongly with oil than with water. The [[Chemical polarity|polar]] "heads" of the surfactant molecules coating the micelle interact more strongly with water, so they form a [[hydrophilic]] outer layer that forms a barrier between micelles. This inhibits the oil droplets, the hydrophobic cores of micelles, from merging into fewer, larger droplets ("emulsion breaking") of the micelle. The compounds that coat a micelle are typically [[amphiphilic]] in nature, meaning that micelles may be stable either as droplets of aprotic solvents such as oil in water, or as protic solvents such as water in oil. When the droplet is aprotic it sometimes is known as a reverse micelle.]]

==Composition and structure==
Surfactants are usually [[organic compound]]s that are [[amphiphilic]], meaning they contain both [[hydrophobic]] groups (their ''tails'') and [[hydrophilic]] groups (their ''heads'').&lt;ref name="The Lipid Chronicles"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bubbles, Bubbles, Everywhere, But Not a Drop to Drink|url=http://www.samuelfurse.com/2011/11/bubbles-bubbles-everywhere-but-not-a-drop-to-drink/|work=The Lipid Chronicles|accessdate=1 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, a surfactant contains both a water-insoluble (or oil-soluble) component and a water-soluble component. Surfactants will diffuse in water and [[Adsorption|adsorb]] at [[Interface (chemistry)|interfaces]] between air and water or at the interface between oil and water, in the case where water is mixed with oil. The water-insoluble hydrophobic group may extend out of the bulk water phase, into the air or into the oil phase, while the water-soluble head group remains in the water phase.

World production of surfactants is estimated at 15 Mton/y, of which about half are [[soap]]s.  Other surfactants produced on a particularly large scale are [[linear alkylbenzenesulfonate]]s (1700 kton/y), [[lignin sulfonate]]s (600 kton/y), [[fatty alcohol]] [[ethoxylate]]s (700 ktons/y), and [[alkylphenol]] [[ethoxylate]]s (500 kton/y).&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;Kurt Kosswig "Surfactants" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH, 2005, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a25_747}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Structure of surfactant phases in water===
In the bulk aqueous phase, surfactants form aggregates, such as [[micelles]], where the hydrophobic tails form the core of the aggregate and the hydrophilic heads are in contact with the surrounding liquid. Other types of aggregates can also be formed, such as spherical or cylindrical micelles or [[lipid bilayer]]s. The shape of the aggregates depends on the chemical structure of the surfactants, namely the balance in size between hydrophilic head and hydrophobic tail. A measure of this is the HLB, [[Hydrophilic-lipophilic balance]]. Surfactants reduce the [[surface tension]] of water by [[Adsorption|adsorbing]] at the liquid-air interface. The relation that links the surface tension and the surface excess is known as the [[Gibbs isotherm]].

===Dynamics of surfactants at interfaces===
The dynamics of surfactant adsorption is of great importance for practical applications such as in foaming, emulsifying or coating processes, where bubbles or drops are rapidly generated and need to be stabilized. The dynamics of adsorption depend on the [[diffusion coefficient]] of the surfactant. As the interface is created, the adsorption is limited by the diffusion of the surfactant to the interface. In some cases, there can exist an energetic barrier to adsorption or desorption of the surfactant. If such a barrier limits the adsorption rate, the dynamics are said to be ‘kinetically limited'. Such energy barriers can be due to steric or electrostatic repulsions.
The [[surface rheology]] of surfactant layers, including the elasticity and viscosity of the layer, play an important role in the stability of foams and emulsions.

==Characterization of interfaces and surfactant layers==
Interfacial and surface tension can be characterized by classical methods such as the
-pendant or [[spinning drop method]].
Dynamic surface tensions, i.e. surface tension as a function of time, can be obtained by the [[Maximum bubble pressure method|maximum bubble pressure apparatus]]

The structure of surfactant layers can be studied by [[ellipsometry]] or X-Ray reflectivity.

[[Surface rheology]] can be characterized by the oscillating drop method or shear surface rheometers such as double-cone, double-ring or magnetic rod shear surface rheometer.

===Detergents in biochemistry and biotechnology===
In solution, detergents help solubilize a variety of chemical species by dissociating aggregates and unfolding proteins.  Popular surfactants in the biochemistry laboratory are [[Sodium lauryl sulfate|SDS]] and [[Cetyl trimethylammonium bromide|CTAB]]. Detergents are key reagents to [[Liquid-liquid extraction|extract]] protein by lysis of the cells and tissues: They disorganize the membrane's lipidic bilayer (SDS, [[Triton X-100]], [[Triton X-114|X-114]], [[CHAPS detergent|CHAPS]], [[Cholate|DOC]], and [[NP-40]]), and solubilize proteins. Milder detergents such as [[n-Octyl beta-D-thioglucopyranoside|octyl thioglucoside]], [[octyl glucoside]] or [[maltosides|dodecyl maltoside]] are used to solubilize membrane proteins such as [[enzymes]] and [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]] without [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denaturing]] them. Non-solubilized material is harvested by centrifugation or other means. For [[electrophoresis]], for example, proteins are classically treated with [[Sodium lauryl sulfate|SDS]] to denature the native [[protein structure|tertiary and quaternary structures]], allowing the separation of proteins according to their [[molecular weight]].

Detergents have also been used to decellularise organs. This process maintains a matrix of proteins that preserves the structure of the organ and often the microvascular network. The process has been successfully used to prepare organs such as the liver and heart for transplant in rats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nih.gov/researchmatters/june2010/06282010liver.htm|title=Progress Toward an Artificial Liver Transplant&amp;nbsp;– NIH Research Matters|last=Wein|first=Harrison|date=28 June 2010|publisher=National Institutes of Health (NIH)}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pulmonary surfactant]]s are also naturally secreted by type II cells of the lung [[alveoli]] in [[mammals]].

==Classification==
The "tail" of most surfactants are fairly similar, consisting of a [[hydrocarbon]] chain, which can be branched, linear, or aromatic. [[Fluorosurfactant]]s have [[fluorocarbon]] chains. [[Siloxane surfactant]]s have [[siloxane]] chains.

Many important surfactants include a polyether chain terminating in a highly [[Chemical polarity|polar]] anionic group. The polyether groups often comprise ethoxylated ([[polyethylene oxide]]-like) sequences inserted to increase the hydrophilic character of a surfactant. [[Polypropylene oxide]]s conversely, may be inserted to increase the lipophilic character of a surfactant.

Surfactant molecules have either one tail or two; those with two tails are said to be ''double-chained''.

[[File:TensideHyrophilHydrophob.png|thumb|400px|Surfactant classification according to the composition of their head: nonionic, anionic, cationic, amphoteric.]]

Most commonly, surfactants are classified according to polar head group. A non-ionic surfactant has no charged groups in its head. The head of an ionic surfactant carries a net positive, or negative charge. If the charge is negative, the surfactant is more specifically called anionic; if the charge is positive, it is called cationic. If a surfactant contains a head with two oppositely charged groups, it is termed zwitterionic.  Commonly encountered surfactants of each type include:

===Anionic===

====Sulfate, sulfonate, and phosphate esters====
[[Anion]]ic surfactants contain anionic functional groups at their head, such as [[organosulfate|sulfate]], [[sulfonate]], [[phosphate]], and [[carboxylic acid|carboxylate]]s.
Prominent alkyl sulfates include [[ammonium lauryl sulfate]], [[sodium lauryl sulfate]] (sodium dodecyl sulfate, SLS, or SDS), and the related alkyl-ether sulfates [[sodium laureth sulfate]] (sodium lauryl ether sulfate or SLES), and [[sodium myreth sulfate]].

Others include:
*[[Docusate]] (dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate) 
*[[perfluorooctanesulfonic acid|Perfluorooctanesulfonate]] (PFOS)
*[[Perfluorobutanesulfonic acid|Perfluorobutanesulfonate]]
* Alkyl-aryl ether phosphates
* Alkyl ether phosphates

====Carboxylates====
These are the most common surfactants and comprise the alkyl carboxylates (soaps), such as [[sodium stearate]].  More specialized species include [[sodium lauroyl sarcosinate]] and carboxylate-based fluorosurfactants such as [[perfluorononanoic acid|perfluorononanoate]], [[Perfluorooctanoic acid|perfluorooctanoate]] (PFOA or PFO).

===Cationic head groups===
{{prose|section|date=August 2013}}
* pH-dependent primary, secondary, or tertiary [[amine]]s: Primary and secondary amines become positively charged at pH &lt; 10:{{Cite web  | title = Bordwell pKa Table (Acidity in DMSO) | url = http://www.chem.wisc.edu/areas/reich/pkatable/index.htm | publisher =  | date =  | accessdate = 11 May 2014 }}
** [[Octenidine dihydrochloride]];
* Permanently charged [[quaternary ammonium salts]]:
** [[Cetrimonium bromide]] (CTAB)
** [[Cetylpyridinium chloride]] (CPC)
** [[Benzalkonium chloride]] (BAC)
** [[Benzethonium chloride]] (BZT)
** [[Dimethyldioctadecylammonium chloride]]
** [[DODAB|Dioctadecyldimethylammonium bromide]] (DODAB)

===Zwitterionic surfactants===
[[Zwitterion]]ic ([[amphoteric]]) surfactants have both cationic and anionic centers attached to the same molecule.  The cationic part is based on primary, secondary, or tertiary [[amine]]s or quaternary ammonium cations.  The anionic part can be more variable and include sulfonates, as in the [[hydroxysultaine|sultaines]] [[CHAPS detergent|CHAPS]] (3-[(3-Cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate) and [[cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine]]. [[Betaine]]s such as [[cocamidopropyl betaine]] have a carboxylate with the ammonium. The most common biological zwitterionic surfactants have a phosphate anion with an amine or ammonium, such as the [[phospholipids]] [[phosphatidylcholine|phosphatidylserine]], [[phosphatidylethanolamine]], [[phosphatidylcholine]], and [[sphingomyelin]]s.

===Nonionic surfactant===
Many long chain alcohols exhibit some surfactant properties.  Prominent among these are the [[fatty alcohol]]s, [[cetyl alcohol]], [[stearyl alcohol]], and [[cetostearyl alcohol]] (consisting predominantly of cetyl and stearyl alcohols), and [[oleyl alcohol]].

** [[Lauryl glucoside]]
** [[Octyl glucoside]]
* Polyethylene glycol octylphenyl ethers: C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;17&lt;/sub&gt;–(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)–(O-C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;1–25&lt;/sub&gt;–OH:

** [[Nonoxynol-9]]
* [[Glycerol]] alkyl esters:
** [[Glyceryl laurate]]
* Polyoxyethylene glycol sorbitan alkyl esters: [[Polysorbate]]
* Sorbitan alkyl esters: [[Polysorbates#See also|Span]]s
* [[Cocamide MEA]], [[cocamide DEA]]
* [[Dodecyldimethylamine oxide]]
* Block copolymers of polyethylene glycol and polypropylene glycol: [[Poloxamer]]s
* [[Polyethoxylated tallow amine]] (POEA).

===According to the composition of their counter-ion===
In the case of ionic surfactants, the counter-ion can be:
* Monatomic / [[Inorganic compound|Inorganic]]:
** Cations: [[metal]]s : [[alkali metal]], [[alkaline earth metal]], [[transition metal]]
** Anions: [[halide]]s: [[chloride]] (Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;), [[bromide]] (Br&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;), [[iodide]] (I&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;)
* [[Polyatomic ion|Polyatomic]] / [[Organic compound|Organic]]:
** Cations: ammonium, [[pyridinium]], [[triethanolamine]] (TEA)
** Anions: [[tosyl]]s, [[trifluoromethanesulfonate]]s, [[methyl sulfate]]

==In pharmacy==
A wetting agent is a surfactant that, when dissolved in water, lowers the advancing contact angle, aids in displacing an air phase at the surface, and replaces it with a liquid phase. Examples of application of wetting to pharmacy and medicine include the displacement of air from the surface of sulfur, charcoal, and other powders for the purpose of dispersing these drugs in liquid vehicles; the displacement of air from the matrix of cotton pads and bandages so that medicinal solutions can be absorbed for application to various body areas; the displacement of dirt and debris by the use of detergents in the washing of wounds; and the application of medicinal lotions and sprays to surface of skin and mucous membranes.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

==Current market and forecast==
The annual global production of surfactants was 13 million tonnes in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Market Report: World Surfactant Market | publisher = [http://www.acmite.com Acmite Market Intelligence] | url = http://www.acmite.com/market-reports/chemicals/world-surfactant-market.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reznik GO, Vishwanath P, Pynn MA, Sitnik JM, Todd JJ, Wu J, Jiang Y, Keenan BG, Castle AB, Haskell RF Smith TF, Somasundaran P, Jarrell KA."&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Reznik |first1=Gabriel O. |last2=Vishwanath |first2=Prashanth |last3=Pynn |first3=Michelle A. |last4=Sitnik |first4=Joy M. |last5=Todd |first5=Jeffrey J. |last6=Wu |first6=Jun |last7=Jiang |first7=Yan |last8=Keenan |first8=Brendan G. |last9=Castle |first9=Andrew B. |last10=Haskell |first10=Richard F. |last11=Smith |first11=Temple F. |last12=Somasundaran |first12=Ponisseril |last13=Jarrell |first13=Kevin A. |title=Use of sustainable chemistry to produce an acyl amino acid surfactant |journal=Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology |volume=86 |issue=5 |pages=1387–97 |year=2010 |pmid=20094712 |doi=10.1007/s00253-009-2431-8|display-authors=8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the world market for surfactants reached a volume of more than 33 billion US-dollars. Market researchers expect annual revenues to increase by 2.5% per year to around 40.4 billion US-dollars until 2022. The commercially most significant type of surfactants is currently the anionic surfactant alkyl benzene sulfonate (LAS), which is widely used in cleaners and detergents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ceresana.com/en/market-studies/chemicals/surfactants Market Study on Surfactants (2nd edition, April 2015), by Ceresana Research]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health and environmental controversy==
Surfactants are routinely deposited in numerous ways on land and into water systems, whether as part of an intended process or as industrial and household waste. Some of them are known to be toxic to animals, ecosystems, and humans, and can increase the diffusion of other environmental contaminants.&lt;ref name="Metcalfe TL, Dillon PJ, Metcalfe CD"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Metcalfe |first1=Tracy L. |last2=Dillon |first2=Peter J. |last3=Metcalfe |first3=Chris D. |title=DETECTING THE TRANSPORT OF TOXIC PESTICIDES FROM GOLF COURSES INTO WATERSHEDS IN THE PRECAMBRIAN SHIELD REGION OF ONTARIO, CANADA |journal=Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry |volume=27 |issue=4 |pages=811–8 |year=2008 |pmid=18333674 |doi=10.1897/07-216.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Emmanuel E, Hanna K, Bazin C, Keck G, Clément B, Perrodin Y"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Emmanuel |first1=E |last2=Hanna |first2=K |last3=Bazin |first3=C |last4=Keck |first4=G |last5=Clement |first5=B |last6=Perrodin |first6=Y |title=Fate of glutaraldehyde in hospital wastewater and combined effects of glutaraldehyde and surfactants on aquatic organisms |journal=Environment International |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=399–406 |year=2005 |pmid=15734192 |doi=10.1016/j.envint.2004.08.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="M.G.

For example, [[PFOS]] is a [[persistent organic pollutant]] as judged by the [[Stockholm Convention]]. Additionally, [[PFOA]] has been subject to a voluntary agreement by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] and eight chemical companies to reduce and eliminate emissions of the chemical and its precursors.&lt;ref&gt;USEPA: [http://www.epa.gov/opptintr/pfoa/pubs/pfoastewardship.htm "2010/15 PFOA Stewardship Program"] Accessed October 26, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The two major surfactants used in the year 2000 were linear alkylbenzene [[sulfonate]]s (LAS) and the alkyl phenol [[ethoxylate]]s (APE). They break down in the [[wikt:aerobic|aerobic]] conditions found in [[sewage treatment]] plants and in soil to the [[metabolite]] [[nonylphenol]], which is thought to be an [[endocrine disruptor]].&lt;ref name="maria"&gt;Mergel, Maria.

Ordinary dishwashing [[detergent]], for example, will promote water penetration in soil, but the effect would last only a few days (many standard laundry detergent powders contain levels of chemicals such as [[alkali]] and [[chelation|chelating agents]] that can be damaging to plants and should not be applied to soils). Commercial soil wetting agents will continue to work for a considerable period, but they will eventually be degraded by soil micro-organisms. Some can, however, interfere with the life-cycles of some aquatic organisms, so care should be taken to prevent run-off of these products into streams, and excess product should not be washed down.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Anionic surfactants can be found in soils as the result of sludge application, wastewater irrigation, and remediation processes. Relatively high concentrations of surfactants together with multimetals can represent an environmental risk. At low concentrations, surfactant application is unlikely to have a significant effect on trace metal mobility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hernández-Soriano Mdel |first1=C |last2=Degryse |first2=F |last3=Smolders |first3=E |title=Mechanisms of enhanced mobilisation of trace metals by anionic surfactants in soil |journal=Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987) |volume=159 |issue=3 |pages=809–16 |year=2011 |pmid=21163562 |doi=10.1016/j.envpol.2010.11.009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hernández-Soriano Mdel |first1=C |last2=Peña |first2=A |last3=Dolores Mingorance |first3=M |title=Release of metals from metal-amended soil treated with a sulfosuccinamate surfactant: effects of surfactant concentration, soil/solution ratio, and pH |journal=Journal of Environmental Quality |volume=39 |issue=4 |pages=1298–305 |year=2010 |pmid=20830918 |doi=10.2134/jeq2009.0242}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biosurfactants enhance the emulsification of hydrocarbons, have the potential to solubilise hydrocarbon contaminants and increase their availability for microbial degradation. The use of chemicals for the treatment of a hydrocarbon polluted site may contaminate the environment with their by-products, whereas biological treatment may efficiently destroy pollutants, while being biodegradable themselves. Hence, biosurfactant-producing microorganisms may play an important role in the accelerated bioremediation of hydrocarbon-contaminated sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Rosenberg, E., Ron, E.

In some bacterial species such as ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'', biosurfactants are also involved in a group motility behavior called [[swarming motility]].

==Safety and environmental risks==
Most anionic and nonionic surfactants are nontoxic, having [[LD50]] comparable to sodium chloride.  The situation for cationic surfactants is more diverse. Dialkyldimethylammonium chlorides have very low [[LD50]]'s (5 g/kg) but alkylbenzyldimethylammonium chloride has an LD50 of 0.35 g/kg.  Prolonged exposure of skin to surfactants can cause chafing because surfactants (e.g., soap) disrupts the lipid coating that protects skin (and other) cells.&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt;

===Biosurfactants and Deepwater Horizon===
The use of biosurfactants as a way to remove [[petroleum]] from contaminated sites has been studied and found to be safe and effective in the removal of petroleum products from soil. Other studies found that surfactants are often more toxic than the oil that is being dispersed, and the combination of the oil and the surfactant can be more toxic than either alone.  Biosurfactants were not used by [[BP]] after the [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill]].  However, unprecedented amounts of [[Corexit]] (active ingredient: dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate (DOSS), sorbitan monooleate (Span 80), and polyoxyethylenated sorbitan monooleate [[Polysorbate 80|(Tween-80]])),&lt;ref&gt;European Maritime Safety Agency.

Biosurfactants produced by microbe or bacteria can be used to enhance oil production by microbial enhanced oil recovery method (MEOR).&lt;ref&gt;Hakiki, Farizal.
