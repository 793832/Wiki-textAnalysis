'''Protein production''' is the [[biotechnology|biotechnological]] process of generating a specific [[protein]]. It is typically achieved by the manipulation of [[gene expression]] in an organism such that it [[gene expression|expresses]] large amounts of a [[recombinant gene]]. This includes the [[transcription (biology)|transcription]] of the [[recombinant DNA]] to messenger [[RNA]] ([[mRNA]]), the [[translation (biology)|translation]] of mRNA into [[polypeptide]] chains, which are ultimately folded into functional [[proteins]] and may be [[protein targeting|targeted]] to specific subcellular or extracellular locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gräslund|first1=Susanne|last2=Nordlund|first2=Pär|last3=Weigelt|first3=Johan|last4=Bray|first4=James|last5=Gileadi|first5=Opher|last6=Knapp|first6=Stefan|last7=Oppermann|first7=Udo|last8=Arrowsmith|first8=Cheryl|last9=Hui|first9=Raymond|last10=Ming|first10=Jinrong|last11=dhe-Paganon|first11=Sirano|last12=Park|first12=Hee-won|last13=Savchenko|first13=Alexei|last14=Yee|first14=Adelinda|last15=Edwards|first15=Aled|last16=Vincentelli|first16=Renaud|last17=Cambillau|first17=Christian|last18=Kim|first18=Rosalind|last19=Kim|first19=Sung-Hou|last20=Rao|first20=Zihe|last21=Shi|first21=Yunyu|last22=Terwilliger|first22=Thomas C|last23=Kim|first23=Chang-Yub|last24=Hung|first24=Li-Wei|last25=Waldo|first25=Geoffrey S|last26=Peleg|first26=Yoav|last27=Albeck|first27=Shira|last28=Unger|first28=Tamar|last29=Dym|first29=Orly|last30=Prilusky|first30=Jaime|last31=Sussman|first31=Joel L|last32=Stevens|first32=Ray C|last33=Lesley|first33=Scott A|last34=Wilson|first34=Ian A|last35=Joachimiak|first35=Andrzej|last36=Collart|first36=Frank|last37=Dementieva|first37=Irina|last38=Donnelly|first38=Mark I|last39=Eschenfeldt|first39=William H|last40=Kim|first40=Youngchang|last41=Stols|first41=Lucy|last42=Wu|first42=Ruying|last43=Zhou|first43=Min|last44=Burley|first44=Stephen K|last45=Emtage|first45=J Spencer|last46=Sauder|first46=J Michael|last47=Thompson|first47=Devon|last48=Bain|first48=Kevin|last49=Luz|first49=John|last50=Gheyi|first50=Tarun|last51=Zhang|first51=Fred|last52=Atwell|first52=Shane|last53=Almo|first53=Steven C|last54=Bonanno|first54=Jeffrey B|last55=Fiser|first55=Andras|last56=Swaminathan|first56=Sivasubramanian|last57=Studier|first57=F William|last58=Chance|first58=Mark R|last59=Sali|first59=Andrej|last60=Acton|first60=Thomas B|last61=Xiao|first61=Rong|last62=Zhao|first62=Li|last63=Ma|first63=Li Chung|last64=Hunt|first64=John F|last65=Tong|first65=Liang|last66=Cunningham|first66=Kellie|last67=Inouye|first67=Masayori|last68=Anderson|first68=Stephen|last69=Janjua|first69=Heleema|last70=Shastry|first70=Ritu|last71=Ho|first71=Chi Kent|last72=Wang|first72=Dongyan|last73=Wang|first73=Huang|last74=Jiang|first74=Mei|last75=Montelione|first75=Gaetano T|last76=Stuart|first76=David I|last77=Owens|first77=Raymond J|last78=Daenke|first78=Susan|last79=Schütz|first79=Anja|last80=Heinemann|first80=Udo|last81=Yokoyama|first81=Shigeyuki|last82=Büssow|first82=Konrad|last83=Gunsalus|first83=Kristin C|display-authors=1| title=Protein production and purification|journal=Nature Methods|date=February 2008|volume=5|issue=2|pages=135–146|doi=10.1038/nmeth.f.202|pmid=18235434|pmc=3178102}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Protein production systems (in lab jargon also referred to as 'expression systems') are used in the [[life sciences]], [[biotechnology]], and [[medicine]]. [[Molecular biology]] research uses numerous proteins and enzymes, many of which are from expression systems; particularly [[DNA polymerase]] for [[polymerase chain reaction|PCR]], [[reverse transcriptase]] for RNA analysis, [[restriction endonuclease]]s for cloning, and to make proteins that are screened in [[drug discovery]] as [[biological target]]s or as potential drugs themselves. There are also significant applications for expression systems in [[industrial fermentation]], notably the production of [[biopharmaceuticals]] such as human [[insulin]] to treat [[diabetes]], and to manufacture [[Enzyme#Industrial applications|enzymes]].

===Cell-based systems===
The oldest and most widely used expression systems are cell-based and may be defined as the "''combination of an [[expression vector]], its cloned DNA, and the host for the vector that provide a context to allow foreign gene function in a host cell, that is, produce proteins at a high level''".&lt;ref name="urlDefinition: expression system from Online Medical Dictionary"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://cancerweb.ncl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/omd?expression+system | title = Definition: expression system  | date = 1997-11-13 | format = | work = Online Medical Dictionary | publisher = Centre for Cancer Education, University of Newcastle upon Tyne: Cancerweb | pages = | language = | archiveurl = | archivedate = | quote = | accessdate = 2008-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="urlExpression system"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.biology-online.org/dictionary/Expression_system | title = Expression system - definition | date = 2005-10-03 | format = | work = Biology Online | publisher = Biology-Online.org | pages = | language = | archiveurl = | archivedate = | quote = | accessdate = 2008-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overexpression is an abnormally and excessively high level of [[gene expression]] which produces a pronounced gene-related [[phenotype]].&lt;ref name="Overexpression - Oxford"&gt;{{cite web|title=overexpression|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/overexpression|website=Oxford Living Dictionary|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=18 May 2017|date=2017|quote=The production of abnormally large amounts of a substance which is coded for by a particular gene or group of genes; the appearance in the phenotype to an abnormally high degree of a character or effect attributed to a particular gene.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Overexpress - NCI"&gt;{{cite web|title=overexpress|url=https://www.cancer.gov/publications/dictionaries/cancer-terms?cdrid=45812|website=NCI Dictionary of Cancer Terms|publisher=National Cancer Institute at the National Institutes of Health|accessdate=18 May 2017|quote=overexpress&lt;br /&gt;In biology, to make too many copies of a protein or other substance. Overexpression of certain proteins or other substances may play a role in cancer development.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many ways to introduce foreign [[DNA]] to a cell for expression, and many different host cells may be used for expression — each expression system has distinct advantages and liabilities. Expression systems are normally referred to by the [[Host (biology)|host]] and the DNA source or the delivery mechanism for the genetic material. For example, common hosts are [[bacteria]] (such as ''[[Escherichia coli|E.coli]]'', ''[[B. subtilis]]''), [[yeast]] (such as ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae|S.cerevisiae]]''&lt;ref name="pmid21943899"/&gt;) or eukaryotic [[cell lines]]. Common DNA sources and delivery mechanisms are [[virus]]es (such as [[baculovirus]], [[retrovirus]], [[adenovirus]]), [[plasmid]]s, [[Bacterial artificial chromosome|artificial chromosome]]s and [[bacteriophage]] (such as [[lambda phage|lambda]]). The best expression system depends on the [[gene]] involved, for example the ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'' is often preferred for proteins that require significant [[posttranslational modification]]. [[Insect]] or [[mammal]] cell lines are used when human-like splicing of mRNA is required. Nonetheless, bacterial expression has the advantage of easily producing large amounts of protein, which is required for [[X-ray crystallography]] or [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] experiments for structure determination.

Because bacteria are [[prokaryote]]s, they are not equipped with the full enzymatic machinery to accomplish the required post-translational modifications or molecular folding. Hence, multi-domain eukaryotic proteins expressed in bacteria often are non-functional. Also, many proteins become insoluble as inclusion bodies that are difficult to recover without harsh denaturants and subsequent cumbersome protein-refolding.

To address these concerns, expressions systems using multiple eukaryotic cells were developed for applications requiring the proteins be conformed as in, or closer to eukaryotic organisms: cells of plants (i.e. tobacco), of insects or mammalians (i.e. bovines) are transfected with genes and cultured in suspension and even as tissues or whole organisms, to produce fully folded proteins. Mammalian ''[[in vivo]]'' expression systems have however low yield and other limitations (time-consuming, toxicity to host cells,..). To combine the high yield/productivity and scalable protein features of bacteria and yeast, and advanced epigenetic features of plants, insects and mammalians systems, other protein production systems are developed using unicellular eukaryotes (i.e. non-pathogenic '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''[[Leishmania]]''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' cells).

==== Bacterial systems ====

===== ''Escherichia coli'' =====
[[File:EscherichiaColi NIAID.jpg|thumb|right|''E. coli'', one of the most popular hosts for artificial gene expression.]]
''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' is one of the most widely used expression hosts, and DNA is normally introduced in a [[plasmid]] expression vector. The techniques for overexpression in ''E. coli'' are well developed and work by increasing the number of copies of the gene or increasing the binding strength of the promoter region so assisting transcription.

For example, a DNA sequence for a protein of interest could be [[cloning#Cloning in biology|cloned]] or [[subcloning|subcloned]] into a high copy-number plasmid containing the ''[[lac operon|lac]]'' promoter, which is then [[transformation (genetics)|transformed]] into the bacterium ''E. coli''. Addition of [[IPTG]] (a [[lactose]] analog) activates the lac promoter and causes the bacteria to express the protein of interest.

===== ''Corynebacterium'' =====
Non-pathogenic species of the gram-positive ''[[Corynebacterium]]'' are used for the commercial production of various amino acids. The ''[[Corynebacterium glutamicum|C. glutamicum]]'' species is widely used for producing [[glutamate]] and [[lysine]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brinkrolf | first1 = K | last2 = Schröder | first2 = J | last3 = Pühler | first3 = A | last4 = Tauch | first4 = A | year = 2010 | title = The transcriptional regulatory repertoire of Corynebacterium glutamicum: reconstruction of the network controlling pathways involved in lysine and glutamate production | url = | journal = J Biotechnol | volume = 149 | issue = 3| pages = 173–82 | doi=10.1016/j.jbiotec.2009.12.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; components of human food, animal feed and pharmaceutical products.

Expression of functionally active human [[epidermal growth factor]] has been done in ''C. glutamicum'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Date | first1 = M | last2 = Yokoyama | first2 = K | last3 = Umezawa | first3 = Y | last4 = Matsui | first4 = H | last5 = Kikuchi | first5 = Y | year = 2006 | title = Secretion of human epidermal growth factor by Corynebacterium glutamicum | url = | journal = Lett Appl Microbiol | volume = 42 | issue = 1| pages = 66–70 | doi=10.1111/j.1472-765x.2005.01802.x | pmid=16411922}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus demonstrating a potential for industrial-scale production of human proteins. Expressed proteins can be targeted for secretion through either the general, [[secretory pathway]] (Sec) or the [[twin-arginine translocation pathway]] (Tat).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Meissner | first1 = D | last2 = Vollstedt | first2 = A | last3 = van Dijl | first3 = JM | last4 = Freudl | first4 = R | year = 2007 | title = Comparative analysis of twin-arginine (Tat)-dependent protein secretion of a heterologous model protein (GFP) in three different Gram-positive bacteria | url = | journal = Appl Microbiol Biotechnol | volume = 76 | issue = 3| pages = 633–42 | doi=10.1007/s00253-007-0934-8 | pmid=17453196}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike [[gram-negative bacteria]], the gram-positive ''Corynebacterium'' lack [[lipopolysaccharides]] that function as antigenic [[endotoxins]] in humans.

===== ''Pseudomonas fluorescens'' =====
The non-pathogenic and gram-negative bacteria, ''[[Pseudomonas fluorescens]]'', is used for high level production of recombinant proteins; commonly for the development bio-therapeutics and vaccines.  '' P. fluorescens'' is a metabolically versatile organism, allowing for high throughput screening and rapid development of complex proteins. ''P. fluorescens''  is most well known for its ability to rapid and successfully produce high titers of active, soluble protein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Retallack | first1 = Jin | last2 = Chew | first2 =  | year = 2011 | title = Reliable Protein Production in a Pseudomonas fluorescens Expression System | url = | journal = Protein Expression and Purification | volume = 81 | issue = | pages = 157–65 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Eukaryotic systems ====

===== ''Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Pichia Pastoris'' =====
Expression systems in yeast typically use the common and well known ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae|S. cerevisiae]]'', but also ''[[Bacillus]]'' ''sp''. Systems using ''[[Pichia pastoris]]'' allow stable and lasting production of proteins closer to mammalian cells, at high yield, in chemically defined media of proteins.

===== ''Filamentous fungi'' =====

Filamentous fungi, especially ''[[Aspergillus]]'' and ''[[Trichoderma]]'', but also more recently ''[[Myceliophthora thermophila]]'' C1&lt;ref name="Visser 214–223"/&gt; have been developed into expression platforms for screening and production of diverse industrial enzymes. The expression system C1 shows a low viscosity morphology in submerged culture, enabling the use of complex growth and production media.

===== ''Baculovirus-infected cells'' =====
Infected insect cells&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1023/A:1026488408951 |year=1999 |last1=Altmann |first1=Friedrich |journal=Glycoconjugate Journal |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=109–23 |pmid=10612411 |last2=Staudacher |first2=E |last3=Wilson |first3=IB |last4=März |first4=L |title=Insect cells as hosts for the expression of recombinant glycoproteins}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Sf9 (cells)|Sf9]], [[Sf21]], [[High Five cells|High Five]] strains) or mammalian cells&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0958-1669(99)00005-1 |title=Recombinant baculoviruses as expression vectors for insect and mammalian cells |year=1999 |last1=Kost |first1=T |journal=Current Opinion in Biotechnology |volume=10 |issue=5 |pages=428–33 |pmid=10508635 |last2=Condreay |first2=JP}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[HeLa]], [[HEK 293 cells|HEK 293]]) allow production of glycosylated or membrane proteins that cannot be expressed using yeast or prokaryotic cells (''E. coli'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Altmann|first=Friedrich|last2=Staudacher|first2=Erika|last3=Wilson|first3=Iain B.

===== ''Non-lytic insect cell expression'' =====
Non-lytic insect cell expression is an alternative to the lytic baculovirus expression system. In non-lytic expression, vectors are transiently or stably [[Transfection|transfected]] into the chromosomal DNA of insect cells for subsequent gene expression.&lt;ref name=Dyring&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dyring | first1 = Charlotte | year = 2011 | title = Optimising the drosophila S2 expression system for production of therapeutic vaccines | url = | journal = BioProcessing Journal | volume = 10 | issue = | pages = 28–35 | doi=10.12665/j102.dyring}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Olczak&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Olczak | first1 = Mariusz | last2 = Olczak | first2 = Teresa | year = 2006 | title = Comparison of different signal peptides for protein secretion in nonlytic insect cell system | url = | journal = Analytical Biochemistry | volume = 359 | issue = | pages = 45–53 | doi=10.1016/j.ab.2006.09.003 | pmid=17046707}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is followed by selection and screening of recombinant clones.&lt;ref name=McCarroll&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McCarroll | first1 = L. | last2 = King | first2 = L.A. | year = 1997 | title = Stable insect culture for recombinant protein production | url = | journal = Current Opinion in Biotechnology | volume = 8 | issue = | pages = 590–594 | doi=10.1016/s0958-1669(97)80034-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The non-lytic system has been used to give higher protein yield and quicker expression of recombinant genes compared to baculovirus-infected cell expression.&lt;ref name=Olczak /&gt; Cell lines used for this system include: [[Sf9 (cells)|Sf9]], [[Sf21]] from ''[[Spodoptera frugiperda]]'' cells, [[High Five cells|Hi-5]] from ''[[Cabbage looper|Trichoplusia ni]]'' cells, and [[Schneider 2 cells]] and Schneider 3 cells from ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'' cells.&lt;ref name=Dyring /&gt;&lt;ref name=McCarroll /&gt; With this system, cells do not lyse and several cultivation modes can be used.&lt;ref name=Dyring /&gt; Additionally, protein production runs are reproducible.&lt;ref name=Dyring /&gt;&lt;ref name=Olczak /&gt; This system gives a homogeneous product.&lt;ref name=Olczak /&gt; A drawback of this system is the requirement of an additional screening step for selecting viable [[Clone (cell biology)|clones]].&lt;ref name=McCarroll /&gt;

===== ''Leishmania'' =====
[[Protozoa]]n ''[[Leishmania]] tarentolae'' (non-pathogenic strain) expression systems allow stable and lasting production of proteins at high yield, in chemically defined media. Produced proteins exhibit fully eukaryotic post-translational modifications, including [[glycosylation]] and disulfide bond formation.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

===Cell-free systems===
Cell-free production of proteins is performed ''in vitro'' using purified RNA polymerase, ribosomes, tRNA and ribonucleotides. These reagents may be produced by extraction from cells or from a cell-based expression system. Due to the low expression levels and high cost of cell-free systems, cell-based systems are more widely used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rosenblum | first1 = G | last2 = Cooperman | first2 = BS | date = Jan 2014 | title = Engine out of the chassis: cell-free protein synthesis and its uses | journal = FEBS Lett. | volume = 588 | issue = 2| pages = 261–8 | doi = 10.1016/j.febslet.2013.10.016 | pmid = 24161673 | pmc=4133780}}&lt;/ref&gt;
